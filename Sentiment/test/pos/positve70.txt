This is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly. I live right down the street from here but unfortunately I have only gone a once. Trust me I will go here more often. The food is great prices are low and the staff are friendly. My cousin and I wanted a place to eat and catch up and this was perfect place. I will go here more often.This is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly. I live right down the street from here but unfortunately I have only gone a once.
