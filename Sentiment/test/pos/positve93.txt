I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.My pop is kinda grumbly and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.Well my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot considering he lives in Murrysville. The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine at it was only 1 pm. Dad while not a teetotaler rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. Can I say I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini my mom had a pizza and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing delicous and inexpensive. In Austin you can't get a decent italian meal much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.I know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh.
