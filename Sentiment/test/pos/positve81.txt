Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again it's probably my favorite restaurant in Carnegie. Simple setup just a small restaurant with a few tables and a TV. Oddly enough I think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup never had better. The food is average but I always enjoyed eating there great service and a cheap place to get Chinese food.Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again it's probably my favorite restaurant in Carnegie.
