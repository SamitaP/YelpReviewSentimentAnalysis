Yay I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic spinach feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.Like the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting.  The bar was jumping thou never go to the bar.Yay I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow it was very good for us this visit.
