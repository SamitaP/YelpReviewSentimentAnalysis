I went there for dinner last night with a client.  This is second time I visited.  I had a scotch and he had a Guiness.  The (-1) is for drink selection. Just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and you're five stars.We started with the meatballs covered with Provolone and other blessed goodness.  These did not disappoint.  I had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic.  It was fantastic.  They have so many good dishes but I wanted the pizza last night.  I couldn't finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.I finished up with a coffee.  The parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street but it's a small town atmosphere in Carnegie PA.  I love the downtown there.I went there for dinner last night with a client.  This is second time I visited.  I had a scotch and he had a Guiness.  The (-1) is for drink selection.
