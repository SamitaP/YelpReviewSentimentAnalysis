I came here with two friends prior to visiting Apis Meadery next door this past weekend.  I ordered the General Tso's chicken and my friends ordered the sesame chicken crab rangoon and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  They ordered the combo with less meat and I ordered the one with more--the names were very similar which I found confusing. The food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.) so I'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  While we were waiting the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).To be honest I'm not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived in Singapore for 3 mos. and have visited Hong King and Japan); it's been awhile since I've had it and this dish reminded me why.  I don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce nor do I care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (I like to cut up my own meat thank you very much) so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  Having said that my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare they'd had in PGH (and they live in Squirrel Hill!) so if you're a fan of this cuisine you can take that into consideration.If nothing else this meal provided us with some much-needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead which I appreciated.I came here with two friends prior to visiting Apis Meadery next door this past weekend.
