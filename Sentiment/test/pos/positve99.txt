I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.Both times I had the banana pepper appetizer which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.For entrees me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  I've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. The service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time the server was lackluster didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.  I would return to Papa J's but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson.I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.Both times I had the banana pepper appetizer which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.For entrees me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.
