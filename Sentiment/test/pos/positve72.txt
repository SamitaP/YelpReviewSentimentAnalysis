My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. It was easy to find and no problems with parking. It's Seat Yourself but there were no signs stating this so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks dropped them off and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love but come on now. We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. The food was alright really nothing special. A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. We may or may not go back.My husband and I tried this place for the first time today.
