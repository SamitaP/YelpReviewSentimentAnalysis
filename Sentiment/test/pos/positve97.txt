This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great salads bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers ravioli fish white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food.This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat.
