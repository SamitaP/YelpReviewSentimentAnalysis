Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming the food was nothing special in fact it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad which was bland (I make a better version at home) chicken salad nothing special either and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately it was the size of a quarter it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).We were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!Then the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte again fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  Oh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World) cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately when I asked for more tea they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! I've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there ever!
