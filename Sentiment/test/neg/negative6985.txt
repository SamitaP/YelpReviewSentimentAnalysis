If you can't find this place it's because it's above Pamela's.  I liked all the crafts in here.  It was cute lots of different things colorful clothes toy llamas etc.  But I really came here for the Peruvian food.If you are looking for Papas a la Huancaina or ceviche it isn't here.  It's salads sandwiches empanadas and a few other entrees like arroz tapado.  This is a good place for a healthy lunch but I would not come here for dinner.  After looking at the menu and nothing jumped at me I got the empanada platter.  It was...ok.  Not that amazing.  I got the beef the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas.  The cilantro wasn't even that prevalent in the chicken empanada.  My spinach empanada was comparable to a less flaky spanakopita.  The beef empanada need more flavor!  Sigh.  Don't get me wrong I wanted to like this place.I will say the coffee was good and the server was very pleasant.  This is a nice place to get some cool gifts.
