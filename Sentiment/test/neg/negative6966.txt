Unimpressed.  Food is okay and service is good but it's just not that great.The food alone would be 4 stars if they were charging a bit less (Yes - I think value matters.  Almost anyone can serve you an above-average meal if price isn't an issue.)  The empanada was pretty good but $3.50 for a tiny little beef empanada is ridiculous.  They're street food for chrissake.  (The pickled onion condiment with them is really good though.)  I had the tortilla de papa which was pretty good and my partner had a chicken dish (name escapes me) that was pretty good as well and the salads were good.  Back to the pricing thing: they do have Inca Kola which I love but they charge $2.50 for a can.  I only got one because my partner had never had one but $2.50?  Really?  I know the profit's in the drinks for restaurants but a 12-pack of it cost the same as a 12 of Coke the last time I saw it in a grocery store.Service was good.  Very friendly.  4 stars.Decor leaves much to be desired.  This is usually an area that doesn't bug me too much with restaurants but this place looks ratty - worn carpet cheap tile faded pictures of someone's trip to Peru furniture that looks like it belongs in a chain motel breakfast room.  The knickknacks for sale are nice but they're not in a separate area so it feels like you're eating in the middle of a gift shop.  Again not awful if you're charging $5-7 or so per plate but not when you've crossed the $10 threshold.  1 star.I'm split between 2 and 3 stars but I'm skewing low on this place.
