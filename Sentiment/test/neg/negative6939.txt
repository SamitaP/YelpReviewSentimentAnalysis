Come for the food and not the atmosphere or service. I Made reservations for 7 pm on a Friday. When we got there was a line out the door. After pushing our way to the front of the crowded entrance to inform the host we were here we found a crowd of people standing there complaining that they haven't seen the host in 10 minutes. The host finally came to the front and I said we had reservations. He asked who else had reservations for two which no one did except for me and my girlfriend. Without asking for my name we were seated right next to the host's podium where he had to pull out the table so we could fit to sit down. We were practically sitting on the laps of the couple next to us. The waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations. Aside from the poor service and chaos the food was pretty good. I had the risotto which was a little bland but the sausage and mussels made up for it. Also I was surprised by the limited number of seafood options. I will give girasole another chance at a less busy time but was not impressed.
