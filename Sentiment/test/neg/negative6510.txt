I don't really have a good review for this place. It's not that the place isn't good it's just that I don't have an accurate experience to recount.I went for bacon night. This is on Tuesdays.I saw an outside patio on my way in. On a nice day that area seems...nice.But the happy hour was good. And once the bacon started it kept flowing. So by far this was the best part. Oh so while I would have usually given this place 3 stars for simply existing and providing me free bacon I knocked it down due to the really inept barstaff. I spent way too long at the bar before being acknowledged to order a drink.Yeesh. Too bad I wasn't as cute as one of those girls at the end of the bar.
