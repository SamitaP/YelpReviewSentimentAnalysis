How does this place survive in the middle of Walnut Street?  I understand how people like to wait in line for hours for breakfast on a Sunday but I WOULD NOT do it for a place like this.  Given our first mistake was going for breakfast at a place labeled a dive bar on yelp---but still.  Perhaps the wait wasn't meant to be an hour but our waitress definitely FORGOT OUR ORDER and we sat there wondering what could be so tricky about some eggs and toast.  ...one hour and one complaint later...The food arrives.  Hot sauce was more difficult took two requests before it came.  Of course I arrived last and ordered 30 min after everyone else but my food came first.  The food is basic and inexpensive you get what you pay for.  In summary my Shadyside friends unless it's a beautiful day and you just want to sit outside (their only plus is they have a few outside tables) keep on going down Walnut for some better options.
