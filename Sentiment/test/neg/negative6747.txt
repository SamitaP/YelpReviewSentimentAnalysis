Crappy's is more like it... sorry I could NOT resist!This place is very below average.  The bar is small good luck getting a seat it's normally filled with regulars who I have a sneaking suspicion drink for a reduced rate ;)   Also the food is blah; they advertise that it is healthier because it is all baked. Um this results in super fattening foods baked.. this does not mean it is healthy by any means who do they think they are kidding?? LOLAnyways as other reviewers have mentioned the decor is 1975 and wicker all over.  With so many options in Shadyside I don't see any reason to go here.
