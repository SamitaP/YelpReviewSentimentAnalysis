Went to Elbow Room for a nice Sunday brunch experience. It was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly. My girlfriend ordered the album pancakes while I ordered the crab Eggs Benedict.  Her pancakes were absolutely inedible with such a bizarre after taste that we had to say something to the waitress. The kitchen also forgot to put any hollandaise sauce on my eggs and it looked like a 10 year old had poached them. The asparagus was raw and there were a few bits of crab so little I thought they had forgotten that too. By the time I got any hollandaise the eggs were cold and the whole plate was ruined. When we said something about the pancakes the waitress apologized profusely and brought out some fresh French Toast but stated that the cooks also thought something was wrong with the pancakes - - - why did she let us order them then?? Makes no sense.The waitress was very nice and very attentive but the cooking left a lot to be desired. We won't be going back there for brunch anytime soon. Worst Eggs Benedict experience I've ever had.
