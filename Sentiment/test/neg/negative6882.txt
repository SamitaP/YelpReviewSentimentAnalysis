Food was excellent but we hated the ambiance! Reservations at 7:00 pm Saturday. Arrived on time. Couldn't get in the door to wait for them to clear table because there were so many people in the narrow entrance; had to stand outside in cold weather. The place was so loud we couldn't hear our waitress and thus the specials or the people we were seated with. Everyone is back to back; no place to hang a coat or move between tables to visit the restroom. We won't go back.
