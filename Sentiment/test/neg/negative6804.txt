I never really understood why Doc's was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise the prices suck (beer served in 10 ounce cups on special for $2.50 - come on) the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is nonexistent.  The drinks are weak as well.  If you're looking for a night out there are better places close by in Shadyside.  The deck really is nice but it doesn't help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks especially for what you get.  That being said I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I'm missing something.
