After months and months on hiatus I have made a resolution that I think I'll actually be able to keep (unlike the NYE 'resolutions' exercise and less carbs) and that is to get back to the good work of keeping up with yelp and my amateur reviews.  It started to feel like homework but all fair and decent people need be warned of the good and the bad this and other cities have to offer by impartial peers'.  Now it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was Girasole last night.  However I feel the need to document the experience immediately.  If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today very loud...decent service a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min 20 min 25 min...Okay I'll try to make this easy..Sir may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?...Sure what is it?.  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min 35 min 40 min 50 min...Now keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact which we do.  Okay I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars'  but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale doesn't matter if you have a reservation doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.  We won't be back to Girasole.
