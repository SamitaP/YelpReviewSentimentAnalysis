Most times I absolutely love a little place with a lot of character...  unfortunately Girasole manages to provide both but not in a good way.While the dinning room itself has some great traits (stone walls coppertop tables etc.) diners more or less are forced to eat almost on top of one another.  As with most small joints Girasole has the stereotypical quirky owner that is completely passionate about their business unfortunately in this case the owner slugged down 3-4 glasses of wine in what seemed to be an hour...  shouting up the stairs outside at patrons and ushering them around like cattle.Relative to the food I was super excited for a seasonal menu.  Going against my biggest desires to get the risotto I decided on the spring chicken dish (hoping for some lighter fare as well).  Ravioli chicken breast sauteed greens and a seasoned broth.  While attractive looking the ravioli seemed like they came from a frozen bag the chicken breast was dry and the broth was bland.  While the greens were decent there were barely enough for a few bites.Maybe everyone else sees something I don't because this place seems to be constantly packed.
