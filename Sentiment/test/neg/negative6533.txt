Light your torches and get the pitchforks because I'm not shy about writing scathing reviews on some of Pittsburgh's beloved restaurants. I don't enjoy doing it.  I love our city and I think our diverse restaurant choices make us a great place to live and visit. But when I hear great things about a place only to be consistently let down I have no choice.  That being said I'm going to have to rip Harris Grill a new one. I waited a long time before reviewing Harris Grill.  I've been there loads of times; happy hours bacon night brunch crowded Friday nights and not-so-crowded Monday nights.  Almost every time I have been let down. I'll break it down. DRINKS: The drink menu and draft lift offer a solid list of (overpriced) choices.  That's fine.  What isn't so fine is that the bartending is inconsistent and I have too often received ill-concocted highballs and sangria that tastes like Franzia.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky but almost every time I'm there at least one or two beer taps aren't working. APPETIZERS: Nothing really wrong here.  Good spinach and buffalo chicken dips the Britney Spears (chicken strips) and hummus are all very tasty. Thumbs up.MAIN COURSES: I guess it depends on your taste but I am simply not enthralled by any of the entrees.  The salads are overpriced for their small size their highly touted macaroni and cheese is bland and their chicken quesadillas are NOT quesadillas.  Just about everything on the menu at Harris Grill is overpriced for the quality.  $17 dollars for homemade hamburger helper?  $16 for two fish tacos? I don't HATE anything on the Harris Grill menu.  Their entrees are between ok and good. Just overpriced.  I do enjoy the Henny Penny and as I said before all of the appetizers.  I'd give them a 3-star review if it wasn't for the....SERVICE:  Or lack thereof.  Sure Harris Grill gets crowded especially on the weekends.  That does not excuse the waitstaff from being rude and ignoring their tables for upwards of an hour.  On one occasion our server clearly forgot about us and we watched astounded as tables seated long after us were brought their meals.  When we finally did inquire about our food  the waiter made a beeline for the computer to put in our orders.  No apologies no offer to comp a side or a dessert.  In fact the check was rushed to us before we even finished our food because the restaurant had a long waiting list.  Bad form Harris Grill. What makes it worse is that I've been here many times and have had similar problems with the service. But truth be told I'll probably be back.  Because I really want to like Harris Grill. Moreover my friends love Harris Grill and I love my friends.  I just sincerely hope they hire more competent waitstaff.  Revising their menu wouldn't be a bad idea either...
