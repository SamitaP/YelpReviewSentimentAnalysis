Since my return to Pittsburgh I have been to the new Elbow Room several times. The food has always been decent and the location on Walnut is convenient when I'm in the neighborhood shopping.  Today I went for a late lunch.  Honestly there were 5 people in the restaurant.  It took forever for food to arrive at our table.  Could it be attributed to the fact that I was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they aren't sufficiently staffed?  I don't know.  My beloved was happy as always with his ENORMOUS fish sandwich.  My reuben sandwich was just okay.  The corned beef was pretty chewy.  Probably should have gotten a salad.  I'm hoping that I just caught them on a bad afternoon.
