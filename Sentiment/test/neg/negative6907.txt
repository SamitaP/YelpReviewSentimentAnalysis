LOUD!When someone says the name Girasole's - that's the first thing that pops into my head. So loud you have to essentially shout to have a conversation with your table-mate. Small place so everything is pretty cramped together. Service is quick genuine and attentive. Food was slightly above average but far from memorable - just not worth putting up with the noise level over. Perhaps for takeout....Had the greens and beans w/ the Cappa Santa.
