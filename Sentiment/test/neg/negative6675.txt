My wife and daughter and I walked in and were seated immediately by the hostess.  We sat down and browsed the menu and made our selections.  Ten or so minutes passed by as various wait staff passed by our table. At about the fifteen minute mark without even as much as water service we got up and left.  The hostess as well as  the wait staff that we passed by on or way out the door made no attempt  to engage us in any way.  There wasn't much of a crowd there and I don't expect with this type of service business to be picking up any time soon.
