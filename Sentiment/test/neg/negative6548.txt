Let me tell you about my experience at the Harris Grill I know I have eaten here before years ago. So I was in need of a lunch and off to the garden. I decided a nice salad would do the trick so I ordered the Salad de la Burgh. While I waited for my meal I was sitting in the little room right off the bar first thing I notice is the table is a tad sticky then I noticed the hole in the wall. After these little gems I started to scope out the place kind of soak in the atmosphere. Filth the joint is run down and fifthly make matters worse was the cement block propping open the door to the patio outside ( this is the front door to the restaurant people ). The restaurant was busy and my server was a pleasant enough young woman. I received my beverage and then started to check the staff out and how unkempt most of them where jeans extremely tight and unflattering on the best figures Harris Grill shirts were not much better trust. I long for the day when restaurants hired servers because they had mad skills not because they are young or hip. My favorite is when I realize that under the host station there were bus pans ( dirty & full ) one young employ thought nothing of maneuvering it with her foot ( disgusting it is on the floor but also the unsanitary way it was handle )Let me now explain the salad I got for eleven dollars and some cents. The lettuce was about a cup spring mix I think not crisp and wilty and kind of room temperature. The chicken was cold so was the few fries they put on it and a half a hardboiled egg. I think I found a few pieces of onion? Two grape size tomatoes and two thin slices of cucumber. Oh there was a sprinkling of mozzarella or provolone cheese on it could not tell which ( they say both so I will go for that ). This was placed in an average soup bowl. To say I will ever go back to the Harris Grill is a definite not & I will warn others to avoid. PS I did not expect the salad to be huge or grand but decent and somewhat hearty this was subpar could have gotten a better one at Wendy's and it would have been warm meat and fries ...
