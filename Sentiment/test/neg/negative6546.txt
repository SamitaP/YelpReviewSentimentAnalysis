Disclaimer: This review is only for their Sunday brunch. Wasn't impressed by their Sunday brunch. Didn't like the presentation of the buffet. It was in a small area and felt kind of cramped. The salad was made with iceberg lettuce and didn't look appetizing. My friends ordered orange juice and each glass was filled to the brim with large pieces of ice which means that they really just had maybe 1/2 a glass of orange juice. In all it's really nothing special just very basic. It was my first time eating at Harris Grill. What seems nice is the patio and if the weather had been nice we would've sat outside and maybe I would've given it an extra star.
