I'm a longtime fan of the Harris Grill so please note that my review is specific to brunch only.  My friends and I were lucky enough to get patio seating on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. That was the highlight of brunch- friends and the patio. The only option for brunch is to get the buffet. They were packed and couldn't keep enough food out.  The Mac and Cheese while cheesily delicious was cold. They kept running out of plates. They never had the salmon when I went up- yet I saw it on other patrons plates.  And insult to injury my Bloody Mary was watered down. My friend had a Bloody Mary and the olive in it tasted like chlorine. I will give props to the guy making the omelets.  He had all the ingredients was quick and friendly. Like I said I'm a big Harris Grill fan and will be back again - just not for brunch.
