I have nothing good to say about this place. I've been here on several occasions over the years and here's what I have observed:1- If the place is crowded (which it almost always is) expect terrible service from your waiter/bartender. Waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu.2- The food will be overpriced/sub par. On one occasion me and my entire party got food poisoning from their fried calamari3- You will be seated somewhere awkward/uncomfortable. The interior is cool looking but not functional gets very congested when there are big crowds. There are plenty of other bar/restaurant destinations in Pittsburgh that can deliver and execute the same idea in a much better way. Avoid Harris Grill.
