Pros: convenient location in Shadyside sufficient lighting for the moodCons: Crowded full of frat-boy types bartenders would kick everyone out at closing timePerhaps I didn't have a great experience because I got dragged here against my will.But it was unbearably crowded and loud.  The kind where it's most likely that you'll spill someone's else's drink.  It was more than once that I heard glass breaking.  It's a kind of place you would go to meet random people than a place you would go to just hang out with friends. My friends enjoyed their drinks so I grant the bar that.  At closing time however the bartender yelled that we had to get out since it was closing.  They turned on the bright lights cut the music and stopped the heat to force us out.So I might not be the target audience.  This is my friend's favorite bar.  I am not sure why.  The frat-boy like atmosphere may be it but I have always preferred the low-key type bars.
