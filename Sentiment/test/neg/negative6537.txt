I've visited Harris's Grill a few times over the past 3 - 4 years and every time I leave I ask myself Why do people love this  place so much!? The food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best. Minus the bacon gimmicks and pretentious Shadyside vibe... This place is an average bar/restaurant.
