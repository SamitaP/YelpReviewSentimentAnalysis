Doc's is a decent place in the Spring and Summer when their 2nd floor upstairs patio is open. They have reasonably priced pitchers of beer and well drinks. It's nice to sit outside and relax after a long day of school or work.The beer selection isn't that great and the upstairs bar is not full. Sometimes their drink specials are served in tiny plastic cups. The service can also be rather slow.I am not a big fan of their food (pizzas are bland and the burgers overcooked) although it is nice to split an appetizer with a group of people.
