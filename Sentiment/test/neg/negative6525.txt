A pleasant enough little place for Hipster Yinzers to engage in those unique conversations where everyone talks simultaneously and loudly and no one is heard. The fare is somewhat overpriced for minuscule drinks meager portions and lackluster service.  Oddly everyone seems to rave about their tater tots......yeah the same processed frozen spud you enjoyed in elementary/parochial school.
