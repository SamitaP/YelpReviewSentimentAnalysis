Probably the worst bar in Shadyside to go on Friday/Saturday nights. Waaay too crowded and loud. The clientele sucks - it's people in their mid to late-20's desperately trying to cling onto their college years by being loud and obnoxious. It does have a nice back patio that is heated during the winter and smoking is permitted which is nice. If you are there on a week night it might not be so bad.Drink prices aren't anything special and cocktails aren't that strong.I'd venture a guess that this is a good hang-out spot during sporting events. It feels very sports-bar oriented.I would say this is a good bar to go with a large drunk group and that's it. If you are by yourself or in a small group Cappy's or Mardi Gras would be much better IMO.
