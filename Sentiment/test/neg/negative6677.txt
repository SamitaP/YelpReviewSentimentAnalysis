Place was interesting. The decor reminds you of cheers because of the wood. I had a salmon wrap and it was very good. It had a mustard sauce and came with fries. Prices were decent. Our waitress lacked personality and her breath smelled bad but she got everything.food wise right. It took awhile to bring our drinks. I split the check with my friend and she didn't divide the items correctly.I probably wouldn't come here again because it wasn't special. If I'm coming all the way from Monroeville then I want more bang for my buck.
