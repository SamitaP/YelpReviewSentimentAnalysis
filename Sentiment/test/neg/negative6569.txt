I can't properly review the food or beverage selections since I never actually got seated.  I came as part of a large group who specifically chose Harris Grill because it could handle a crowd.  When we arrived the lounge area--clearly designed to seat 15-20 people--was occupied by precisely two individuals.  That's right two people leisurely sipping drinks.  The host informed us when we entered that they would be leaving soon.  Half an hour later they had ordered another drink and seemed to be making small talk with the host: clearly a friend of theirs.  This begs the question: why on earth would a host seat two people in their party section?  I came up with two possible answers.1. The restaurant hates money2. They hired the worst host in PittsburghI'll be returning to Harris Grill sometime this month to try their food all of which looked and smelled amazing as it whisked past me on plates destined for tables.  In response to the comment below I wrote this review to call attention to a business practice which seems mutually detrimental to both the restaurant and the customer.  I don't hold grudges and I'm willing to treat the experience as a one-off.
