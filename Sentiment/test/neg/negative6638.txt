Well my update has half of my original rating. Not because of their food but because of the service. My friend booked her birthday party there this past Saturday night in their tavern room. When we got there the room that was supposed to be set up for her party and guests was completely full of other restaurant patrons. She had called in advance to confirm party details and they assured her that everything would be fine. Not the case when we got there. The person she set the party up with wasn't working that night and it took the hostess 15 minutes to find his note that was left about the party. It took another hour for them to clear somewhat of an area for the party which was now squeezed into the bar area. The whole area never fully got cleared out for her party and we had to share space with people who they had sat in that hour that we had waited for it to clear out. They also put only one server on staff which was insanity and chaos because there were 30 of us at this party. I think she got 1 out of every 4 drink orders correct. I would still go here to eat for dinner but I would never recommend it to anyone looking to have a party or event here.
