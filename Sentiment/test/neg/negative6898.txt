My boyfriend and I had just casually walked by Girasole to see what their menu looked like. Before we even asked for a menu the front of house staff quickly asked us whether or not we wanted to sit outside squished behind a baby's highchair in a corner or inside where it was very crowded. We tried to politely ask the man if we could see a menu first. After looking at the menu we decided we liked what the menu had on it but it was just really crowded. When we returned the menu to the front of the house staff he snatched the menu away from us and said Yeah I knew you guys weren't going to buy anything anyway. What if we were about to order something? That completely turned us away from this restaurant. We could tell we were just another group of people to get in and get out. Very rude and unacceptable. Never going back.
