I fully agree with reviewers who call the food bland and overall I think there are much better dining options for the money in the vicinity.  I have tried a number of items on the menu here and found them to be all underwhelming despite the fact that their average entree costs nearly $20.For example the hanger steak has come out under-seasoned and chewy the braised short ribs tasting no better than ones you can easily make at home -- again despite being roughly $20 or more each.  The starters that I have had were also very uninspiring such as the hummus which is at best on par with store-bought hummus.  For a restaurant at this price point it is simply not worth the money.For cheap eats in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh I prefer options like BRGR or Dinette.  At either of those locations entrees are less expensive while much more consistent and flavorful.
