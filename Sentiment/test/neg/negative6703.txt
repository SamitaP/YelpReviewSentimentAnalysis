First of all the website as I was told has been down for 4 years - even though it is very up. The specials and menu prices are apparently wrong.My friends and I chose this place solely based on the fact they had advertised $3.50 20 oz Guinness. We needed a place to celebrate our graduation. With a party of 4 that grew to 6 we found the place pretty crowded and loud after awhile. Mostly we were pissed off that we were told on our 3rd round that the Guinness we were drinking was actually $5.50....really it wasn't even a full 20 oz glass it was one of those damn plastic cups. When we ordered at the beginning of the night it was quiet and the bartender said nothing about the price. At that point we decided to go somewhere else because it really wasn't our kind of bar in the first place and you can absolutely find much cheaper Guinness in this city. The guy didn't even apologize for the website - it's called false advertising and it's a dick move Mr. William Penn.
