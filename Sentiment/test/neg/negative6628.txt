Been there twice in the last year.  The service was mediocre once and embarrassingly bad the second time.  The food is good; it's Meatloaf-Centric American.  It's a place you'd take your conservative parents.That said the first time I was in some of the regular customers were being ridiculously outgoing about politics and decided to group-hate some things I find pretty reasonable.  Didn't seem reasonable to argue with a large group of folks in their regular spot so ah that's that.If you can't find plain-to-upscale American food in Pittsburgh you're really not looking very hard.  Reading another review I'd be baffled trying to figure out why anyone would take the bus here.
