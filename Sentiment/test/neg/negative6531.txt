This place offers really poor service. The waitstaff go out of their way to not help you. This has happened to many people I know multiple times. We put up with it so we could get the brunch. We stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter. He was flat out rude and upset my friend so we left and won't be coming back. The food isn't that great (the tacos/fajitas are terrible and flavorless as is the salad) the drinks are grossly overpriced and the service as I mentioned before is slow and inept. On the plus side the brunch is great (it just ended because of winter) the food is relatively well-priced and the location is great (if you can find parking). I recommend going elsewhere though because it just isn't worth being treated so poorly by the staff. Management should take note.
