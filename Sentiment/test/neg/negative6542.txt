Came here with a party of 5 others for brunch at 11am on a Sunday. We were seated immediately but were surprised to learn that there is no brunch buffet during the winter.My eggs benedict was good so was my bloody mary. Don't expect vegetables and meat to go together here--they are mutually exclusive options on this menu. That said I counted only 3 dishes with any vegetables at all. The coffee was disappointing--it came with plastic cups of half & half. Any respectable restaurant should do better.Overall the food is good heavy and served in decent-sized portions. I would come here again although there are certainly better venues for brunch in the city.
