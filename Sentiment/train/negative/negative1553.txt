Not sure why my review was flagged but I can assure that Im not an employee or another restaurant making trouble for a competitor just an average consumer that lives on the Northside .         When will I ever learn. I really want to like this place. It's a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size but it is always really good.Sunday brunchA neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find. So for dinner and lunch my original 2 stars stand but the Sunday brunch is a solid 4 1/2 stars.Not sure why my review was flagged but I can assure that Im not an employee or another restaurant making trouble for a competitor just an average consumer that lives on the Northside .
