I must admit I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.

But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp!I must admit I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.
