Went on a Wednesday night not crowded at all. Had to get up and go find someone to wait on our table....overheard who was supposed to be our server telling the hostess she didn't wait on us because she didn't want another table. The food was good lobster roll and fish sandwiches were great. Service was just awful.Went on a Wednesday night not crowded at all.
