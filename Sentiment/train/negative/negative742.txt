This place has the worst service I've ever seen. I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins. When I got to the counter the lady working rudely told me to wait for my name to be called because she didn't have my ticket to ring up the order. Um okay...then walk over and get it so i can pay for it! So I waited and waited as people who came in long after me got their orders. The workers just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal. I had to leave without my order after 40 minutes. DO NOT GO HERE!This place has the worst service I've ever seen. I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins.
