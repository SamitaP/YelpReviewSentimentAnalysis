We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.Both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust) a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.Can't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself.We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie.
