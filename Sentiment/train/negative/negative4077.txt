I'm not quite sure what happened to Papa J's in the past year....I remember always being delighted with my lunches in the past.  When a coworker suggested this last week I was really excited to go back.As soon as we sat down everyone noticed all the dead fruit flies on the table. Yuck.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  He did mess up one order though but she decided just to eat what they mistakenly gave her.  I had the Chicken Piccata.  I just love this dish.  My boyfriend's version is pretty top notch so Papa J's had some high standards to live up to.  It was just meh.  The chicken wasn't very well seasoned and the sauce was overpowered by lemon.  All I could taste was citrus.  I also had a few bites of the Chicken Marsala.  Not sure the ingredients they used in this sauce but holy crap was it sweet.  Really glad I didn't order that dish I wouldn't have been able to eat it!I was really disappointed with this visit.  We probably won't be back any time soon.I'm not quite sure what happened to Papa J's in the past year....I remember always being delighted with my lunches in the past.
