Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated never again!Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.
