Let me start by saying that I do like their food. Last night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.(is that the way rice is prepared now?)I ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one she said we can just squeeze it in there and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.4 people not crowded...2 hours total.Let me start by saying that I do like their food. Last night I went with my wife and two guests.
