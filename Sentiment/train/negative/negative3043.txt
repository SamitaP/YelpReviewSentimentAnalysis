4.5 stars????   Really?????  Based on what?   The food is okay but not great; standard breakfast diner fare.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are all right for what you get.  What I found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating.  The seats at the counter were torn and tilting off the base.  The booths were fast-food style: hard and tight.  It's as if they designed the seating to be uncomfortable so that you wouldn't linger.4.5 stars????   Really?????  Based on what?   The food is okay but not great; standard breakfast diner fare.
