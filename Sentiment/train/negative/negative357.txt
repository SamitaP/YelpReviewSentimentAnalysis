The words epic fail get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.We went on Friday April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.The food (just appetizers mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*By 7:00 we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.Instead of comping anything they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.Bar Louie:  You are dead to me.The words epic fail get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.We went on Friday April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.
