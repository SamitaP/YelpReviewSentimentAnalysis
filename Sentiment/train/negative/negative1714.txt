I am a pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked the fact(s) that:1. Jim Beam is your only bourbon. 2. For some reason two drinks came out to $9.90.* 3. Even with only 10 people in the bar the music was absolutely deafening. 4. You charge a $3 cover for no discernible reason.5. Rolling blunts is apparently kosher inside the bar but sharing not so much.However I can't let this slide: your claw machine is BULLSHIT. That is the weakest claw of all time and there's no chance it is EVER picking up anything in that cage. I feel violated and I want my dollar back. ___________*I think that's some sort of weird PA tax thing.I am a pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked the fact(s) that:1.
