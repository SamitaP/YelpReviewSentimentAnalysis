Great place to get a drink on the deck and watch the river traffic but that's the only good point of the place.  Food's okay - nothing to write home about; service is pretty average and a bit unfriendly; decor is a little too tacky nautical.  Prices are pretty average but too high for the quality and service levels.Great place to get a drink on the deck and watch the river traffic but that's the only good point of the place.
