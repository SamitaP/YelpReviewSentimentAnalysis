It was my Anniversary tonight a Tuesday. I was so excited to get All You Can Eat Crab  Legs!!! My favorite food of all time!!! But when we arrived at 8:20pm the very unfriendly waitress said that their kitchen was closed!!!!! BOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Their website as well as Yelp states that they are open until 10pm!!! We would've been long gone by then! Very disappointing. Well we ended up driving a lot farther than we intended but had a wonderful dinner at Joe's Crab Shack in Station Square. I got my LEGS!!!! And they had $2 Hurricanes to boot!!! Ended up eating a better meal with cheaper drinks and we ended up tipping our waiter 30% because he was awesome!!!! Should've just gone there in the first place! I will know better from now on!!!It was my Anniversary tonight a Tuesday. I was so excited to get All You Can Eat Crab  Legs!!! My favorite food of all time!!!
