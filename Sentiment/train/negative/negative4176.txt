so i go in and order a gyro (yee-ro - you know how you're supposed to say it).  the server goes you mean a 'jai-ro?!' (as in gyroscope) in a very loud kind of condescending voice.  i said no i mean a 'yee-ro'.  as if she didn't know what i was talking about anyway!with the greek authenticity of the place seriously in question i should've walked away then but i was really hungry and didn't have a lot of time for lunch.  it was just average nothing special.  again i've been spoiled by NYC.  besides i think it's a good policy to not eat where they can't properly pronounce what they're serving.so i go in and order a gyro (yee-ro - you know how you're supposed to say it).  the server goes you mean a 'jai-ro?!'
