While the Dor-Stop is a cute place on a nice tree lined street I'm not sure what the big fuss is all about. The food was only fair and they don't even have real cream for your coffee.

It also gave me the heebeegeebees due to the Christianesgue motif.While the Dor-Stop is a cute place on a nice tree lined street I'm not sure what the big fuss is all about.
