I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs. I've just been back for the first time in 6 years after moving away and was pretty unimpressed... The decor looks nice but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta really? It claimed to be fresh pasta but it was completely tough and chewy (not al dente just undercooked) and not very large. I'm not sure when the restaurant changed but I think it really missed the mark... People WANT a casual friendly affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. Why take that away?I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs.
