The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. I could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. The food was a sorry sloppy soggy mess that would have had Chef Ramsey throw up. The service was slow inattentive and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For  better value a nicer atmosphere and quality food I strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat Tambellini's hands down - McDonalds or SubWay.The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum.
