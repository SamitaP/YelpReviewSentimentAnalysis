I was very excited to go here because of all the buzz about this place.  To be honest this place was not that good at all.  The sandwiches although unique were not that good. It was all french fries and very little meat.  My husband and I were almost mad at how little meat was on the sandwiches.  We won't be going back but at least we experienced it.I was very excited to go here because of all the buzz about this place.  To be honest this place was not that good at all.
