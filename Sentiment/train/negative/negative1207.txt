So I admit my boyfriend and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely. We went this past weekend and had brunch. We each had thai coffee which was ok not stupendous not horrible. He ordered the veggie burger and I had the chocolate oatmeal pancakes.His burger was unseasoned and fairly cold my pancakes were okay...but to be honest really lacked flavor (the taste of what I imagine cardboard to be came to mind). I don't discriminate I'm all for veggies and vegan food but just because those are your ingredients doesn't mean you can't cook things well and add seasoning.I am intrigued to go back because the apple cheese panini sounded possibly better than what we had.  I will note that ourwaitress was very sweet and friendly but the food was just lacking in flavor so much that it's really deterred us from going back.So I admit my boyfriend and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely.
