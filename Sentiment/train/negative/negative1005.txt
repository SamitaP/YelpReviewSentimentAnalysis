1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta not sure what.3. Asked for two cabs someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!! Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!1.
