Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu but execution was flawed through out our meal. Also their dishes are not really Portuguese.For appetizers we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.Entrees were on the whole not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger was also overcooked.Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food.
