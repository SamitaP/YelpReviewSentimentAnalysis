Below par diner food. Fried zucchini is all breading and no zucchini. Anything fried always comes dripping in grease I know I know it's diner food but it doesn't have to be so greasy it makes you physically ill. I'm a big fan of blt's and there's is pretty poor. Small portion with very little meat and dry bread.Besides the food the service is so so. Last time I was in I asked for a lemonade and the waitress forgot it asked for mayo and there was none on my sandwich and this was on a slow dayWith eat n park down the street and Pamela's not too far away it seems you have much better places to get you're grub on. I'm giving it one star because I can't see myself ever coming back or recommending the place to anyone else.Below par diner food. Fried zucchini is all breading and no zucchini.
