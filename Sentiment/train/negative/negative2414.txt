I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.The first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order a kitchen guy ran it out and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  I went to the counter for my check and thought that I wouldn't give it another go.  Well you can't say I didn't try. I had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad but its not a place I'd make my go to pizza place.I tried to go here for the second time today.
