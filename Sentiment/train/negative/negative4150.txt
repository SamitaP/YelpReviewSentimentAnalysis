I like a dive restaurant as much as the next person but this is not my kind of place.  It smelled dirty the bartender and the lady who took our orders were both very unpleasant and the food didn't taste fresh.  It just doesn't look clean in there so that is a major concern.  You can be a bit hole-in-the-wallish but you still need to keep the place clean.  Our table smelled like a moldy washcloth had been used to wipe it.  Won't be eating there again.I like a dive restaurant as much as the next person but this is not my kind of place.
