Extremely Slow Service!   We have eaten here many times and while the fish sandwich is great the staff and management have yet to figure out how to manage the tables. This establishment can become quite busy and if you don't aggressively pursue service you are likely to wait 20 minute or more just to get a menu.  This is particularly true if you are sitting in one of the outside areas.Extremely Slow Service!
