I love the location and I keep trying to give Redfin Blues a chance but the food is always average at best and the service is less than mediocre.  The setting is fabulous there's a bike trail that runs right through the middle of the restaurant and you can sit right along the river and feel like you are in some exotic location.  I still enjoy eating here on occasion but I always keep my expectations low about the food and service.  Maybe one day that will change.I love the location and I keep trying to give Redfin Blues a chance but the food is always average at best and the service is less than mediocre.
