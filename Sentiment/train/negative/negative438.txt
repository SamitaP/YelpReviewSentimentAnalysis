I hate this place.It's very loud the service is very poor and the food is so-so.If you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter with very good food & service.I hate this place.It's very loud the service is very poor and the food is so-so.If you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).
