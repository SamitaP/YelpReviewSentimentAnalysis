I don't expect much from fast food restaurants. But I do expect to be spoken to when I am a paying customer. I just went through the drive-thru at this location and other than taking my order at the speaker no one said a word to me. There was a different person at each window and neither of them said hello your total is fuck you nothing. I don't think I've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people. Maybe they're upset because their heroin operation was shut down.I don't expect much from fast food restaurants. But I do expect to be spoken to when I am a paying customer.
