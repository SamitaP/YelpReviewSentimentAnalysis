I have dined at Namaste for the final time.  I am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak: who treats the customer with disdain and indifference.  The words thank you and how are you are not part of the lexicon here.  The buffet items reflect economizing.  Virtually no cauliflower is used thus my favorite dish aloo gobi is never offered..  There sometimes is no rice pudding and in place of the India staple buffet item chicken tandoori the cheaper and less appealing chicken wings are offered.  It is s shame that such a beautiufl comfortable restaurant space is being wasted.  For a mere $1.01 more I can receive a spectacular and delicious array of the finest Indian food in the lovely atmosphere of All India North Craig Street Oakland where I receive gracious personal attention from the owners.I have dined at Namaste for the final time.
