Don't bother. We were kind of desperate to find a place that wasn't too pricy and close to our hotel on a Monday night. We saw this place with the low lighting and witty name (although we weren't sure if they're cleaver enough to make the theater reference or if it was simply a mistake).They boast a new menu and I got the pasta with goat cheese and almonds. I didn't have high expectations but this was like family meal before your serving shift. It was boring and flavor free. My boyfriend got a steak sandwich that looked punny. Oh and the grocery store wine was way over priced.Boo!Don't bother. We were kind of desperate to find a place that wasn't too pricy and close to our hotel on a Monday night.
