Meh. Clam chowder was big and OK.  Veggie sandwich had great  greasy grilled Mancini bread but came with soggy fries and was mediocre overall. Our waitress told us she was new at least 20 times so she wasn't much help in recommending any dishes. I probably won't go back again.  For $25 a person  I can do better elsewhere .Meh.
