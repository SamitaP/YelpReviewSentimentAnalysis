Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce too.  I know it was only $4/$7 for a 6/12 sub but it was pretty bad.  (I bought a 12 intending to take half home for later but I wound up throwing the second half away and I NEVER throw away food.)  As a Italian grocery it seems okay but the attitudes are a little snippy and it's a pretty grungy-looking place.Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce too.
