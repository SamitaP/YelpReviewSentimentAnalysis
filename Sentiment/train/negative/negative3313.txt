I ordered a fave of diners the Pittsburger. cheesesteak.  It's a burger with cheese coleslaw French fries  all piled between 2 thick pieces of bread. Looked ok.  It however didn't work for me. The coleslaw was great though!!It's not much of a cheesesteak. It's a weird burger. That burger seemed like a fried frozen burger. Not much cheese either. My crew had the kielbasa sandwich and the ham sandwich respectively. They looked great. I don't think fries on my sandwich works for me either. I can't hold it against them though. I chose poorly. I think they are probably good though. My motto: eat food you recognize.I ordered a fave of diners the Pittsburger. cheesesteak.
