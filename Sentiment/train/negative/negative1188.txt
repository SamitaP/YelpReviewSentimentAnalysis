Why do vegetarian restaurants think we need fake meat this I do not understand.  I had a primavera sandwich which was just ok but the patty on the roll was just as perplexing as the mystery meat you get in your elementary school cafeteria. My sandwich came with a boring pasta salad and some tortilla chips out of a bag.  Otherwise the atmosphere was fun and the wifi was free if you ask for the password.Why do vegetarian restaurants think we need fake meat this I do not understand.
