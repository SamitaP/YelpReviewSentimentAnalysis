Had a beer and an appetizer so-so.  Service was nice and quick which is about all I need with the kids.  Kids seemed to like their kids meals the usual Mac and cheese grilled cheese chicken fingers.  Huge line at Mad Mex on Friday night none here.  I doubt we will go back too many other choices.Had a beer and an appetizer so-so.
