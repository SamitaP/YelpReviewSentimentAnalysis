The food was fine. It's a chain. I'm not rating it. The service was absolutely horrible. It started well enough when we ordered lunch but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. Between being ignored by the girl at the counter her not listening to the order then arguing with me when I told her I did not ask for what she brought me I really can't decide which is worse. I rather spend my money somewhere local where they appreciate my business rather than take attitude from Panera employees.The food was fine. It's a chain. I'm not rating it.
