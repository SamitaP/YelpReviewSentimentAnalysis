The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery. The wait staff although nice was very salesy always trying to add on something in a pushy way. I asked for my check and barely ate anything. I think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his Best In City award right behind my head as I was still sitting at the table... a shame the award was from 2005! I guess a lot changed in 7 years?Don't bother with this place!The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery.
