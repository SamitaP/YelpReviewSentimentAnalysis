I'm new to Pittsburgh with a job on the North Shore. I had a craving for some Korean food and went to the place nearest my office - Sushi Kim in the Strip District that boasts both Korean food and sushi.Let me say up front - the food I received was delicious. But I was a bit disappointed with the portion size for my lunch entree. For $12.95 I received just a few portions of ribs (I ordered the kalbi) just 3 ban-chan (side dishes of kimchi sprouts and broccoli) a small serving of white rice and a miso soup.Delicious food small portions and a bit overpriced.  I was thinking of coming back to try to sushi but I think the price structure needs to be reworked before I return.I'm new to Pittsburgh with a job on the North Shore.
