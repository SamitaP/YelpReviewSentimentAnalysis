Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that for a third time I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish it was raw.  Needless to say I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?Three strikes and you're out!
