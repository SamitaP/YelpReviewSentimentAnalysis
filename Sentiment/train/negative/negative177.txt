It's okay. Food is cheap but portions are small. For example I order the chicken tenders and I got 3 little tiny tenders and a decent amount of fries. Also the restaurant is not really clean either.  This restaurant is not my number 1 choice.It's okay. Food is cheap but portions are small. For example I order the chicken tenders and I got 3 little tiny tenders and a decent amount of fries.
