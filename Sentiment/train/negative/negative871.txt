I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  I love it because it's extremely close to me (so it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  However I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So it's not really much of a win at all.  Also I want to have a handful of beers during the games but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So all in all I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.I have a love-hate relationship with this place...
