Had dinner here on a weeknight before taking my daughter to the nutcracker.  It was dead but we were early on a Tuesday night and it picked up.  We started with the fried zucchini.  The consensus was thumbs up.  Bread was average.I ordered the veggie pasta.  Asked for it w/out zucchini but was told it wasn't possible as it was pre-made.  It was ok.My daughter had the cheese raviolis and enjoyed them.The other three people had the seafood platter special.  Didn't go so well.  The shrimp and scallops were good the sole was ok but  all three sent theirs back because the lobster wreaked of ammonia.  Our waiter appeared overwhelmed by having to serve a bad product and was only semiapologetic.  They then brought out two manicotti dinners which were fine.Service was average at best.  Feel bad given how long it has been around but it is hard to imagine making a return trip.Had dinner here on a weeknight before taking my daughter to the nutcracker.
