Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes I had to TRY and give them money.On to the important part... Food was terrible. I had a burger and it was pathetic.Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence.
