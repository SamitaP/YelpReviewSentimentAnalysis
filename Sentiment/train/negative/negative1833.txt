I like the double cooked wings but they're like chick wings they're so mini.  The thing that turns me off the most about this place is they have cardboard disposable bowls for their complimentary popcorn - however they get upset if u try and use it to put wing bones or other things in it because they insist on wiping out & reusing the disposable bowls. Disgusting & totally unsanitary IMO. If they insist on reusing those imagine where they are cutting corners behind closed kitchen doors. I'd go back for bottled beer that's about it.I like the double cooked wings but they're like chick wings they're so mini.
