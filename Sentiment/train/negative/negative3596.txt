The food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch.  The service is quick and the prices are reasonable for Downtown.  They are open late hours so sometimes that can be handy.  There are better places for Greek food but Salonika's is often close by.The food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch.
