There are some places that are better when you grow up or at least have memories while eating at a restaurant. This was highly recommended to us while visiting Pittsburgh. First we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a Sunday. We wanted bar type food with a couple of drinks. We were told to go there by several people. I got the capacola great concept putting the coleslaw and fries in the sandwich but it just tasted bland to me. I asked for them to toast the bread but they said they couldn't do it because it sticks to the grill... Can't put a piece of bread on the grill? Again when there a memories of this place I am sure the sandwich taste better than they really are. But as an outsider judging the food alone it was sub par.There are some places that are better when you grow up or at least have memories while eating at a restaurant.
