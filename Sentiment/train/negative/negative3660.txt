So....I read the reviews on Yelp & Urban Spoon.Mostly negative but hey I was hungry and gave it a shot.It's true the place is dingy & like entering a Greek grandfather's home. I was first asked  if I wanted huumus. I declined that after reading is was mediocre at best. So I tried the $5.25 saganaki. It came out in an old brown dish with what looked like rubber floating in lemon juice and oil. * The owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra.It tasted WORSE than it looked (if that was possible). Tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy. * I have had many saganaki in various countries. This ranked as one of the VERY worst! I made the best decision to leave before food poisoning set in. Bottom line:  HORRIFIC !!!So....I read the reviews on Yelp & Urban Spoon.Mostly negative but hey I was hungry and gave it a shot.It's true the place is dingy & like entering a Greek grandfather's home.
