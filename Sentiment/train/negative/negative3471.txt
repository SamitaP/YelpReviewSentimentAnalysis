I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews I thought Eh what the hell.We came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05 we still hadn't seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn't worth it and just left.I did eat here a month ago and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.  Right.I won't be back.I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.
