Primanti Bros is basically the heart of all yinzers in Pittsburgh. However I have to take primanti bros in doses. Their big ass sandwiches make me feel like I dont need to eat the rest of the week. Sometimes I love it for that and sometimes I hate it. Either way its a nice place to sit back relax and enjoy a nice cold beer with my friends.  My only complaint about this particular primanti bros in market square is the people that it generates. Anywhere from hookers to crackheads. I have been in there several times and atleast 4 or 5 times I watched someone get kicked out for doing something illegal. My advice is if you can go to this primantis during the day for lunch dont go at night. If you can go to the one in the strip district or southside on 17th street.Primanti Bros is basically the heart of all yinzers in Pittsburgh. However I have to take primanti bros in doses.
