Previous reviews have said it well: Lackluster tasteless food.Ate at Primanti Bros with a group of friends while in Pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'Man vs. Food' and were assured that it is a Pittsburgh institution. The sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9) but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. Good in theory bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.We also had terrible service at the Market Square location; I'll chalk this up to a fluke. The patio seating at the Market Square location is wonderful on a sunny day but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.The legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch.Previous reviews have said it well: Lackluster tasteless food.Ate at Primanti Bros with a group of friends while in Pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'Man vs. Food' and were assured that it is a Pittsburgh institution.
