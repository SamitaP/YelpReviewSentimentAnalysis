Decided to try the place since I heard about it and is listed in things to do in Pittsburgh. This place is really connected to Pittsburgh itself and Conan even mentioned it in one of his shows as a place to eat at.Ordered the 2nd most popular item which was the cheesesteak that was very very plain. Nothing great about the patty. The thing was HUGE and stacked with fries and coleslaw which I found didn't work well (although there are others out there that do it with success!)You can't deviate and ask for it without the coleslaw either and their menu stated it as All of our sandwiches come with...The portions are huge one order can feed 2 average appetites.  The fries were the only upside of this place.The service here is horrible.. there was 2 people running the place and our tables werent clean and it takes forever.. I don't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place.I don't think I will ever go back again.Decided to try the place since I heard about it and is listed in things to do in Pittsburgh.
