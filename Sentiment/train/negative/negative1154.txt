Well I think Heidi S. pretty much covered all of the bases here. The lemon-ginger tea that I ordered was weak perhaps not steeped hot enough? The hummus wow definitely the worst; tasted like paste.

I considered giving two stars because the service and atmosphere were pleasant but since I do not plan to return I guess methinks not.Well I think Heidi S. pretty much covered all of the bases here.
