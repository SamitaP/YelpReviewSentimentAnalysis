Brought the family to Tom's last weekend and was disappointed.  On the positive side the prices were excellent much better than the canonical breakfast spots in the strip.  However the food was heavy greasy and made from mediocre ingredients.  I didn't care for the spinach  / feta omelet the kids' pancakes were heavy and the home fries were greasy.  True the place felt 50s but kind of worn out.   We won't go again.Brought the family to Tom's last weekend and was disappointed.
