The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The Kölsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well but I was stranded and had free meal tickets so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.
