When I told people I was going to Pittsburgh everyone recommended Primanti Bros. I went and was underwhelmed. It was a big sandwich but the flavour was not amazing. I also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me. As a Chicago native I feel it's the equivalent of people recommending Giordano's or Portillo's. They're not exactly the greatest places in town but they're well-known and popular for one reason or another. Do it just to say you did.I don't like coleslaw.When I told people I was going to Pittsburgh everyone recommended Primanti Bros. I went and was underwhelmed.
