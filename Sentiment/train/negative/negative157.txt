Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we and another party walked out without even being greeted properly I observed several employees traipse out the front door several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high.     Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging.Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us.
