Terrible. I lived about 2 blocks away - and with no other options - I still can't bring myself to order from here. Ordered twice in the last 90 days and both times it was terrible. Ended up waiting over an hour each time. First time I got home to find a totally different order; the send time waited over 1.5 hrs for a pizza. Both were crappy at best. Staff was really rude both times.Terrible. I lived about 2 blocks away - and with no other options - I still can't bring myself to order from here.
