Wow just wow. That was without a doubt the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. Maybe you would like it. Do you like all of your toppings out of a can?

If answer is yes then maybe this place is for you. It is definitely not for me.Wow just wow. That was without a doubt the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. Maybe you would like it.
