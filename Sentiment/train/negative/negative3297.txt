Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.  The presentation of the sandwiches were making my mouth water there's a lot of good things going on in the ingredients...In theory this should've resulted in a bold flavor taste explosion but I found myself severely let down by all of the bland ingredients piled high in front of me.  The pastrami was terrible the coleslaw weak and the fries were bland dry and flavorless.  Still bummed my guess is that this place I more of a tourist draw now than a legit sandwich shop.Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.
