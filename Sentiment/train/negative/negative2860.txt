Have you ever eaten in a place where the whole seems far less than the sum of its parts?  Believe me the Original Fish Market fits that description.  I met my mom and dad here for a pre-concert (Bonnie Raitt) dinner and honestly I wish we'd gone someplace else.  To be fair there wasn't anything particularly wrong with the food or service.  I've enjoyed seafood restaurants before and while my dinner was okay it was only just okay.  There wasn't anything particularly memorable about it.  Nothing that made me say Wow!  My parents didn't hate their dinners either but they weren't impressed.And therein lies the problem.  The Original Fish Market wants to be a swanky hotel restaurant.  It certainly sets its prices high enough ($25.00-$45.00 per entree).  But the quality just doesn't match the price.Have you ever eaten in a place where the whole seems far less than the sum of its parts?  Believe me the Original Fish Market fits that description.
