I was out of town in Pittsburgh and I was told this was the place to go to get the PA experience.  The meal started off pretty well with $2 Yuenglings and amazing chili cheese sour cream and bacon fries.  However things took a turn for the worse when the famous sandwiches came out.  Two of us had the turkey and one had the colossal fish.  I thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird.  The fries added almost no flavor to the sandwich and the cole slaw was gross.  The bread was terrible and overall the sandwich made me nauseous.  Totally not worth it unless you just go for the fries and drinks.I was out of town in Pittsburgh and I was told this was the place to go to get the PA experience.
