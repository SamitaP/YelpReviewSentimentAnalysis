A little pricy for food but not too bad. Sitting above the little docks there is nice on a hot day. When they put the boats in the water it's a little noisy but entertaining. I had a fish sandwich and it was a little greasy and bland and the tartar sauce was also bland. Iced tea was good. This is not the place to come to have a good meal but a nice view and a breeze then it's ok. Next time I think I will just get drinks and an appetizer and enjoy the view.Other people I see complained about the service but our waitress was really good and took care of us without hovering.A little pricy for food but not too bad.
