Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked to have it reheated  still came back cold. Steak was way over cooked. Never got appetizer we ordered but was charged for it.  Was not busy but waitress was hard  to find. Would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone.Roland's was recommended by hotel.
