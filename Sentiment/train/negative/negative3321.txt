Alright so being from Texas I'm used to lots of seasoning lots of flavor and lots of heat if things are supposed to be spicy.  This sandwich shop lacks all of those things.  This was my first shot at local food (I think it's local that's what I was told) and definitely nothing to write home about.  They did have some decent draft beer options but no one in my group of 10 said they would come back.  Try another local joint if you have an option.Alright so being from Texas I'm used to lots of seasoning lots of flavor and lots of heat if things are supposed to be spicy.
