oh primanti's you always disappoint! how can so much food bear so little taste? despite a brilliant premise (put all your edibles in the sandwich leave your other hand free for the potables) the execution leaves much to be desired.1. these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly. they are always greasy on the outside raw and mealy on the inside. don't think that just because they're INSIDE the sandwich doesn't mean you can get away with crappy fries.2. the bread. what the heck dudes? if you're going to put 3 lbs of ingredients in the sandwich try to use a bread that doesn't immediately turn into insipid play-doh in your hands.I like disgusting junk food as much as anyone (see my rave review of the O) but I wish the primanti's goons would put a little bit more effort into their sandwiches. seriously guys -- take some pride in your work and make something good for once. and check the thermostat on your fryolator already!oh primanti's you always disappoint! how can so much food bear so little taste? despite a brilliant premise (put all your edibles in the sandwich leave your other hand free for the potables) the execution leaves much to be desired.1. these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly. they are always greasy on the outside raw and mealy on the inside. don't think that just because they're INSIDE the sandwich doesn't mean you can get away with crappy fries.2. the bread. what the heck dudes? if you're going to put 3 lbs of ingredients in the sandwich try to use a bread that doesn't immediately turn into insipid play-doh in your hands.I like disgusting junk food as much as anyone (see my rave review of the O) but I wish the primanti's goons would put a little bit more effort into their sandwiches. seriously guys -- take some pride in your work and make something good for once. and check the thermostat on your fryolator already!
