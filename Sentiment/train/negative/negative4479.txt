My parents and I came here after my dad had boasted about how good there food was and that he would bring his HP customers here for lunch. Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves. The place was unacceptably dirty our table was dirty the floor was dirty heck even the walls seemed to have a layer of grime. Both the waitress and the bartender were extremely  rude. My mom and I got a beer and my dad tried to order a martini immediately we received dirty looks from both the bartender and the waitress they said they didn't have them so my dad asked for straight vodka in a glass to which she brought a shot  of vodka instead. I understand it's not a full bar or a classy place but to serve alcohol and react the way the servers did was ridiculous! I ordered a grilled fish sandwich that lacked flavor and was horrible greasy the fried scallops were disgusting.I understand that the restaurant has seen better days but wow will i be going back methinks not!My parents and I came here after my dad had boasted about how good there food was and that he would bring his HP customers here for lunch.
