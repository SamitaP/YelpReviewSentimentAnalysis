Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well they omitted the meat but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20 it was close to the price of caviar!Not a good vegan experience.
