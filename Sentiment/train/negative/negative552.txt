The service was mostly friendly but I was disappointed in my meal. My meal was way over cooked. The soda was flat and the carbonation needed changed and I felt like we inconvenienced our server by asking for new ones.  Overall I thought it was mediocre and I was expecting more for the prices.The service was mostly friendly but I was disappointed in my meal. My meal was way over cooked.
