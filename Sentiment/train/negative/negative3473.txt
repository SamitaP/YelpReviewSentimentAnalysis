Went to this place for lunch last Saturday party of five. The service was extremely slow and every beer we tried to order got the response We are out of that one. Finally when we got our sandwiches (after a long wait) but no coleslaw and fries were soggy and stale. When asked the waitress for coleslaw (which is supposed to be the side with every sandwich) the response was I think we are out but let me check. And the waitress didn't return until after we were done eating. Forget about getting a refill for your drink or water..Went to this place for lunch last Saturday party of five.
