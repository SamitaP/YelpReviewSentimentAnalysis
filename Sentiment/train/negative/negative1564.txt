I have stopped going to Max's for regular meals because the food isn't so good but a friend likes to go for Sunday brunch.I find a good portion of the food is acceptable for the brunchexcept the food is not kept hot or even warm on the buffet. Cold kielbasi and sauerkraut is a turn off even though it would be great if it was warmer.  The chef that makes the eggs and omelets to order is really good and the sausage is the best. The bacon and the chicken needs to be cooked a little longer as they are always half raw.So much of what they have would be good if it was kept at least warm. Since they have it in chaffing dishes I've found that the food comes out cold from the kitchen. Makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is.I have stopped going to Max's for regular meals because the food isn't so good but a friend likes to go for Sunday brunch.I find a good portion of the food is acceptable for the brunchexcept the food is not kept hot or even warm on the buffet.
