Alright I heard about this chain on Man v. Food and we just had to try it out. And honestly we were quite disappointed. The sandwich is tasteless unless you douse it with condiments or get a particularly flavorful filling. I got the cheese one and my boyfriend got the colossal fish (both vegetarians--its not so friendly for us...fail). Neither sandwich was impressive--in size or taste. I'm a 54' and 120lb girl and I finished mine no problem. Just incredibly bland. The bread tasted like cheap white bread the fries were just incredibly greasy the cole slaw was hardly cole slaw and more like wet cabbage. The cheese on mine was basically tasteless and my boyfriends fish was definitely from a box of something frozen. Very disappointing.Alright I heard about this chain on Man v.
