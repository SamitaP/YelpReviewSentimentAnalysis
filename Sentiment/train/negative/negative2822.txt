Having read positive things about OFM lately I thought we'd give it another try as it's been years since we've eaten there.  Unfortunately our experience was dreadful.I knew going in that the food was overpriced.  Always has been.  But not only can you get less expensive fish/seafood elsewhere but you also can get FRESHER food at other places.  Our food tasted frozen and overcooked.  What has NOT changed is the extremely poor service.  If you don't look wealthy or if you're not buying multiples rounds of alcohol the wait staff avoids you.  And that was our experience the other night.  How can restaurants get away with poor service and bland food at such high prices?  I guess OFM lives off the travelers and not the locals.Having read positive things about OFM lately I thought we'd give it another try as it's been years since we've eaten there.
