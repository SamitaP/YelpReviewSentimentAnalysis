Unfortunately the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway long story short it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back.Unfortunately the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.
