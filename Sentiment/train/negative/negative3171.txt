Wildly overrated.  I compare it to Pat's and Geno's in Philly good when your drunk but only when your drunk.I went to Pitt for 4 years and I have to say I never understood the Primantis hype.  I dont know how you get famous for putting fries on a sandwich when the fries suck.  They are soggy and tasteless maybe the worst I've ever had.  I will say the coleslaw is pretty good and I'm not usually a coleslaw guy but it doesnt make up for all the other shortcomings.  Half the sandwich falls out while your eating.  The cheesesteak might be the most tasteless sandwich ever.  You have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor.  Primantis sucks...go to Fatheads on the Southside or Uncle Sam's in Oakland.Wildly overrated.
