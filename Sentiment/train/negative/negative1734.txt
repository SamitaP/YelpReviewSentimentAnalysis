The food is acceptable. They have a pretty wide range but narrow the menu on Pirates game days. I tried the seared ahi tuna. It was good but nothing memorable. The location appears to be the best thing about the place. Sitting outside on a warm evening looking at the city skyline and seeing people walk around before a Pirates game is an interested dinner experience. But don't go for the menu.The food is acceptable.
