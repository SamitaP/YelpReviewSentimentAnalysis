I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed! Everything was bland nothing had seasoning not even basic salt. Soggy fries tasteless meat average coleslaw on white bread trying to double for Italian bread. Save your time money and calories and go to Wendy's instead.I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed!
