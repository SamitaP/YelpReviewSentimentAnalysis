Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively famous for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town. The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless a customer should be able to get what they want. This place was trashy dirty and probably not even up to code.Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively famous for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town.
