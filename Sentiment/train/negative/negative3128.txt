My first time at Primanti Bros in Pittsburgh PA.  I was not impressed with my sandwich there.  I've only been once so maybe I ordered the wrong thing but it just wasn't blowing my skirt up.I ordered the corned beef sandwich with the fries and slaw and it tasted a little bland to me.  It needed some sauce.  I think with some mustard this might have been great.  It was dry.  I did enjoy the cole slaw.The service was fast and the server we had was very friendly and attentive.My first time at Primanti Bros in Pittsburgh PA.  I was not impressed with my sandwich there.
