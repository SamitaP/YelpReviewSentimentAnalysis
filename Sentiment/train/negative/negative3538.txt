I've tried and tried to give this place a chance.  It's upsets me that an establishment like this can exist among so many great places in the Strip.  I end up at Roland's because my boyfriend's co-workers always want to go there for happy hour.  They have a special on oysters and shrimp cocktail so I ordered those.  The oysters were absolutely disgusting.  They were not fresh or cleaned very well.  My fingers ended up getting all dirty and they had a gross gritty taste to them.  They threw the POORLY deveined shrimp on ice and it ended up soggy.  I had to pick the veins out myself and after about two I lost my appetite.  As always the service was terrible.  Next time I'm dragged to a happy hour there I'll order water.  Never again will I spend money in this place.  YUCK!I've tried and tried to give this place a chance.
