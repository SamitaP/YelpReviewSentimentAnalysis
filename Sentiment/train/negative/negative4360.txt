Only average at best and when you figure in the slow service cold food and high price i cant even give it an average rating. You can get better Italian food at any hole in the wall in Philadelphia New York or Boston any time. i wanted to love it so much after watching Lidia on TV but the restaurant doesn't bring her own magic to the table it seems.Only average at best and when you figure in the slow service cold food and high price i cant even give it an average rating.
