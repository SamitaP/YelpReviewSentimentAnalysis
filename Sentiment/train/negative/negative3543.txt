We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up. Then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second. After additional 5 minutes we ask her what's going on. She did not apologize and says that it will take another 30 minutes. Really??!! Not the nice way to treat a party of 4 wanting to spend some money.We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up.
