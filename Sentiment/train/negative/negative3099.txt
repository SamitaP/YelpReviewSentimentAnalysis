I'm gonna get slaughtered for giving this place a bad review but whatever. I was told by several people that I absolutely HAD to check out Primanti Bros while I was in Pittsburgh. I was excited about visiting this institution during my stay... but it really didn't deliver for me. Yes this was a huge sandwich with fries and cole slaw in it but the sheer quantity of food didn't make up for the fact that it was really bland. Maybe I just got the wrong thing (the Pittsburger Cheese Steak - which is somehow their #2 seller...?). My friend liked her sandwich which was eggs and bacon I believe. Maybe we just went to the wrong Primanti Bros location. I would give this place another shot if I'm ever in town again but my first impression wasn't a great one.I'm gonna get slaughtered for giving this place a bad review but whatever.
