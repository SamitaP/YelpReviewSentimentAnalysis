Terrible crab bisque. My husband liked the fish stew though.  It had lots of beans was thick and chili-like. The rest of the lunch was so unnoteworthy I can't remember what I ordered though almost all of it was still on the plate at the end of lunch.  I do remember the bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day.Terrible crab bisque. My husband liked the fish stew though.  It had lots of beans was thick and chili-like.
