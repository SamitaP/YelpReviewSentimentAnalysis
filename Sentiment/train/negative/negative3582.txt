This place is the ultimate two star. If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh this is the place to go. Unfortunately Mike & Tony's closes by 6pm. You won't get good service you will get frozen french fries tossed in the deep fryer served in disappointingly small portions. You will have to scrounge around for a bottle of ketchup and hot sauce. However the gyro meat is freshly cut off the spit and the over-stuffed sandwich is a good deal at $4.30. Overall there aren't that many cheap places open at night downtown so go here if you're stranded and can't stand the thought of another Sammy's corned beef sandwich. Otherwise hold out for one of downtown's great lunch spots.This place is the ultimate two star. If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh this is the place to go.
