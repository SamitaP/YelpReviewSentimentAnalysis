Primanti's is a Pittsburgh institution.  The original is in the strip district just outside of downtown proper.  They are famous for large sandwiches with the fries IN the sandwich not on the side.  Idea was born out of truckers wanting a meal they could eat on the road.  Yes if you are in PIT you should probably go once just to say you've been there.  That being said I have been a number of times and tried a number of different sandwiches and to be honest they all were fairly bland.  Lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion.Primanti's is a Pittsburgh institution.  The original is in the strip district just outside of downtown proper.
