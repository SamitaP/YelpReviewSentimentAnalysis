So this is a Pittsburgh instiitution??  Am so underwhelmed.  After waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches) they came out cold - and I'm not just talking about the meat lettuce tomatoes - everything was cold including the fries.  What a disappointment.  Head to DiBellas - much better service subs and sandwiches.So this is a Pittsburgh instiitution??  Am so underwhelmed.
