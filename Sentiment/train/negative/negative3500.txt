Just awful. My companions each ordered an Alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought (through the entire meal) that Roland's had served mashed potatoes on the pasta.We thought maybe it's a 'burgh thing.Nope we were informed at the end of the meal by the waiter that it was indeed Alfredo sauce and that the chef just liked to use a lot of parmesan cheese in his Alfredo. This stuff was about the consistently of cold oatmeal with oil poured over it (no exaggeration) and there was a bucket full of it on each plate.Anybody who would serve what was on those plates has no business whatsoever in any kitchen. By the way my lobster roll was a buttery greasy fail as well.What a complete disaster.Just awful.
