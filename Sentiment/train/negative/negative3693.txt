We went here recently right before a 2-day 150-mile bike ride to carbo-load. The food was okay - probably what we should have expected for the low prices - but the service was horrible. It was not busy but we could not get our waitresses attention despite multiple attempts. We needed a refill and asked for one when she took our dinner order and reminded her when our dinner arrived. We were finally able to flag her down 10 minutes later to remind her again. It also took about 20 minutes to get the check after we had FINISHED our entrees. I am sure that not all of the servers are that bad but I'm not sure I will be back to find out.We went here recently right before a 2-day 150-mile bike ride to carbo-load.
