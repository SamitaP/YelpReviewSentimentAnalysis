Don't bother with the sushi can't speak to the Korean BBQ.Long story short: I ordered delivery. Never had sushi delivered before so maybe this is just the way it goes but it took almost two hours to get to me. There was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree I'd ordered (which was hot) and being held against it in a small bag. Assuming that the rolls were made long before I got them I just threw out the tuna roll which was warmer than room temp anyway. Vegetable roll was good but not exceptional. Fried rice was...just not what I expected not exceptional either. In short I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice. Maybe this is better when you dine in. Still would not recommend. Pricey and doesn't live up to it at all.Don't bother with the sushi can't speak to the Korean BBQ.Long story short: I ordered delivery.
