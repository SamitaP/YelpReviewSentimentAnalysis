Pizza is very hit or miss. When the owners are there it's really good. When they aren't you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and LONG delivery times. The pizza even when plain is very greasy. Way more than other places around. Usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese. Also they do not take credit or debit cards. There are better options.Pizza is very hit or miss. When the owners are there it's really good. When they aren't you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and LONG delivery times.
