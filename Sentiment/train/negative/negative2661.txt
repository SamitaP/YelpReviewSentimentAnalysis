Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  Greeted by a friendly hostess seated and ignored.   After 25 minutes without a server I left.  Will not recommend to anyone else passing through.  I don't know if all the wait staff didn't feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude.  Extremely dissatisfied.Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  Greeted by a friendly hostess seated and ignored.   After 25 minutes without a server I left.
