i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic.  however i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time i've been disappointed.  let's start with the good things.  QS has a great atmosphere it definitely helped the transition from austin.  very chill hippie vibe.  however the servers although friendly can  sometimes be a touch hippie-elitest.  the food was alright.  their homefries were quite tasty but little else has tantalized my taste buds and i have tried many things.  i do love their thai dressing very yummy on the salads.  will i continue to go back?  probably wishful thinking is  a good thing.i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic.  however i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time i've been disappointed.  let's start with the good things.
