I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. The people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall i wouldn't go back.I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay.
