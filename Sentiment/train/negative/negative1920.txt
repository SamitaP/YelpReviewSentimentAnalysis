I knew the original owner of Beto's and she would be furious for what is being done to it now.  If the pizza slice gets any smaller you'll have to call it a breadstick.  There was almost NO meat on my Italian hoagie which used to be the best around.  Whoever recently took over should be ASHAMED.  Betos now STINKS.I knew the original owner of Beto's and she would be furious for what is being done to it now.  If the pizza slice gets any smaller you'll have to call it a breadstick.
