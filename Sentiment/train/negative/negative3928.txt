I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place.  That should have tipped me off.  The last time i was there i had a bad meal but i wanted to give them another shot.  I ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu.  I believe is was L1......Numbered menu items.....Another tip.   My food was terrible.  The miso soup was horrid and old the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.
