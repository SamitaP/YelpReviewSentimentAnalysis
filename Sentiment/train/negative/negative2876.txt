We checked this out for lunch since we were staying at the Weston.The sushi I thought was pretty good.  Nothing outstanding and I probably wouldn't seek it out again but it wasn't bad.  My friends ordered other things off the menu; the verdict was largely that the food looked good but was bland; this was especially apparently true of the fish sandwich.The attached bar is *small* with a very limited selection of beers and liquors.  Perplexingly they also have loads of bar seating but don't open that area for happy hour time.  It seems you could not get appetizers and hang out until some point later in the evening.Super expensive too.  Go somewhere else for lunch there are many better options in the area.We checked this out for lunch since we were staying at the Weston.The sushi I thought was pretty good.
