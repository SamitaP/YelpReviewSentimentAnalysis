I don't understand why this place think's it has famous Corned Beef. I can only believe it's because there are no other deli's downtown.  The restaurant/bar is a dive.  The Corned Beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special.  Not worth the trip.I don't understand why this place think's it has famous Corned Beef.
