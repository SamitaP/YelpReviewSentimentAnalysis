The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards. We ordered for pick up and they forgot our drinks and plastic ware. I will definitely never order from here again. Absolutely disgusting.The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards.
