One word; gross. This is not Italian food - it's Pittsburgh italian food. The ravioli is not fresh - how difficult is it for a restaurant to make fresh ravioli? The decor is tacky. The wine list is lacking. I could rip this place apart after only one disappointing meal but I'm not going to waste my time. In short avoid this place! You can do much better in your own kitchen!One word; gross. This is not Italian food - it's Pittsburgh italian food.
