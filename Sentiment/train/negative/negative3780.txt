Wow not so much.  I haven't been to a Morton's in years but was happy to be going back for a business dinner.  I thought the service was exceptional but the food was mediocre at best.  The filet that I ordered was cooked to perfection a nice portion and tender as can be -- but absolutely no taste.  Nothing.  Nothing discernible at all.  I can tell you that with all of the above and no taste it was all for naught.  Unrelated and not the blame of the server of course -- again service was great -- one of my colleagues found a piece of hard plastic in his veal chop.  He thought the veal chop was great but wasn't real excited about the plastic in his dish which the server promptly removed from the bill.  I brought another colleague's salmon home with me and heated it up the next day.  Oddly enough a beautiful piece of salmon -- absolutely NO flavor.  Very strange experience.  I doubt I'll ever return.  Coincidentally the place was empty on a Thursday evening.Wow not so much.  I haven't been to a Morton's in years but was happy to be going back for a business dinner.
