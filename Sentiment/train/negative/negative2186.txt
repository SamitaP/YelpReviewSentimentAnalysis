The Hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment.  We moved in to the neighborhood and all we heard was Campiti's this Campiti's that and how it is without a doubt the best pizza in the Burgh.So of course we tried it and were pretty excited to do so. Now I have lived in several different Pittsburgh neighborhoods and you always find the pizza you like where you live. Campiti's pizza is not the pizza I like. I wouldn't order a pizza from them again.Honestly it was about up to a frozen pizza standard. Now I'm not saying they are making frozen pizzas they aren't but I have even had better frozen pizzas than the pizza we got from Campiti's.Another reviewer hit the nail on the head saying people who say this is the best pizza around probably have some long running emotional attachment to this place That can be he only logical reason that people actually say it..The Hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment.
