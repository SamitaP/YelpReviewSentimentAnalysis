The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.What really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there...The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine?
