Shockingly bad.  I know it's Pittsburg so my expectations were low but there is no call for rudeness.  The old lady should retire.  The young waiter was ok but clearly  scared of the woman.   I went to the dinner buffet at 530 pm the food was obviously left over from lunch the rice was so old it was crunchy all other food was very low quality and mostly cold. I always like to say something nice so the sweet carrot dish was not horrible.  My search for quality Indian food in the 'burgh continues.Shockingly bad.
