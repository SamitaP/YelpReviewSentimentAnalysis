The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado bacon and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado 1 slice of bacon no lettuce and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No not the kind that you get from the deli the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! Our waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   The manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free.The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado bacon and turkey breast.
