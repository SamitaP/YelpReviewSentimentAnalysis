So I decided to surprise my fiancé one night by taking her here(because we've been talking about doing so for a while). We both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps. The martinis were just ok and the food was very basic and nothing special. I will give the place another try and get some non appetizers next time and hope the bartender is a bit better at mixing the drinks.So I decided to surprise my fiancé one night by taking her here(because we've been talking about doing so for a while).
