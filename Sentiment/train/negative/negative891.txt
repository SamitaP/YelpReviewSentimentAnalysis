This is an average Chinese buffet. The food was not bad but not impressive neither plus some cheap American food. The food was a little too greasy even by American Chinese food standard and my stomach complained soon after I left that place. To me that's a no-go signal.On the other hand they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door perhaps the food would be better there.This is an average Chinese buffet.
