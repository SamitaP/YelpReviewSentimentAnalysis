Stayed @ the hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife no mashed potatoes no asparagus as ordered. So Check your order. I mean for a 2 person $50 meal with tip I would hope the waitstaff would deliver on what was ordered & asked before we left. But skip the 20% $10 room service fee & http://www.sohopittsburgh.com. walk downstairs.Stayed @ the hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife no mashed potatoes no asparagus as ordered.
