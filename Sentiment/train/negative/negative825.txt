The coffee was ok but the service and ambiance left much to be desired. The place was dirty with straw wrappers etc on the floor. The light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy. There were four people on staff but it took at least 2 minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order.  I got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide. It was ok but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout I would not go back.The coffee was ok but the service and ambiance left much to be desired.
