Lidia you should be ashamed! This spot wouldn't have lasted a year in NYC. Citizens of Pittsburgh don't be fooled. Lidia's is average at best. I ate here when it openeda and again 4 years later. Nothing has changed. We did have some great bar nibbles quality cocktails and a good bottle of wine off of a pretty good list but the food and service lacked. For starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads. The took away everything and only brought back fresh salads (mind you we were one of about 10 tables being served that evening!). The entrees were dull and lacked seasoning. The servers were confused (how many times does it take to ask fro fresh pepper?) and our waiter seemed to hand off our table to another server. It's tough to find anything good here. Just another 'poser'.Lidia you should be ashamed! This spot wouldn't have lasted a year in NYC. Citizens of Pittsburgh don't be fooled.
