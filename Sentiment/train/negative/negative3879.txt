I wouldn't call this place authentic Korean BBQ. I was disappointed that the grill at the table was essentially a frying pan. How can you even come close to delicious Korean BBQ if there is no open flame? Every other BBQ restaurant I've been to has had either charcoal or gas grill.The quality of the meats were terrible though one shouldn't really expect much from a buffet.I will say however that the service was friendly and accommodating. It's spacious and thus great for large groups of people. Just don't expect fantastic Korean BBQ.I wouldn't call this place authentic Korean BBQ.
