They charge $4 for a hot dog that is not any different from one you can get at any 7/11 for $1.  Not sure how to review it other than to say have you ever gone into any gas station convenience store in America and gotten a big dog or whatever and put condiments on it?  It's the same thing but 3 more dollars.  They did have other types of dogs but they were more expensive.I hate supporting chains but independent places are supposed to offer something more unique than a neato neon sign.  You might pay as much for a dog in Chicago or New York but they're something special.  For less the amount I could have gotten a corn beef sandwich at various places nearby.  Liked the people and the atmosphere.  Next time I'll try the ice cream.They charge $4 for a hot dog that is not any different from one you can get at any 7/11 for $1.
