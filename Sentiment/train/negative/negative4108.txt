Incredibly slow worst club I've ever had...hilite was the tortilla soup. That was actually edible. Waiting 40 minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable. Especially when we were the 2nd table seated of the day.Incredibly slow worst club I've ever had...hilite was the tortilla soup. That was actually edible.
