I hate Olive Garden. It makes me laugh when they ask how is everything?  I wonder what goes through their minds when I say The microwave did an awesome job. I'm in town for a few days I'm hung over and don't know where else to eat. Olive Garden is just gourmet ChefBoyArDee. You won't find me at an Olive Garden back in New Jersey!I hate Olive Garden.
