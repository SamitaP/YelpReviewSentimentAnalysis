It's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer. It's outdoor dining is right on the river hovering above Washington's Landing Marina. However the service is seriously lacking. With my parent's boat docked right below Redfin's we frequently dine here before headed out on the water. The service has always been very slow. I understand that on a typical Friday or Saturday night it can get rather busy but they should anticipate the crowd and be able to plan accordingly to accommodate! Luckily the view is so nice that most of the time we're left waiting....and waiting....and waiting....it isn't too big of a deal because we're enjoying the outdoor space. The food is average. Nothing I've had there was to die for but on the same token nothing was awful either. I'd only suggest this place to marina-goers or those looking for a nice outdoor dining space. Oh and only come if you have lots of time!It's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer. It's outdoor dining is right on the river hovering above Washington's Landing Marina.
