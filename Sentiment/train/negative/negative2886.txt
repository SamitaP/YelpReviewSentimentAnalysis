Never been before and went on a Thursday night at 6PM before a show. Upon arriving all the good seating near the windows was blocked off for private use (and remained unused). The host told us to go find our own seating wherever we wanted. The setup is interesting with a large open bar area and a small number of tables around the perimeter. We took a seat at a table. The bar seating was fairly full with some milling around in the area and standing and probably a total of 30 people there. We saw at least 5-6 staff a couple sitting around playing on their phones.We sat at our table for 20 minutes and never had a single person come by not to say we will be there shortly not to take a drink order nothing. We could tell this wasn't going to be good so left and no one even noticed.It was a little more bar than restaurant so we weren't sad to leave.Never been before and went on a Thursday night at 6PM before a show.
