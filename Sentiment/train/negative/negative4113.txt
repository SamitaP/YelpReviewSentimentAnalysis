Stopped In before a show at Heinz Hall.  It was not crowded but the waiter was almost useless.  He did not know the beer list drinks went unfilled etc.  Plus I was served teriyaki fajitas.  That's right these were the oddest fajitas I have ever been served.  The taste was OK but it is not what I expect fajitas to be.  That said my wife's Reuben and son's fish and chips were OK.  Overall it was just OK food served by an incompetent waiter.Stopped In before a show at Heinz Hall.  It was not crowded but the waiter was almost useless.
