I was very disappointed with my meal here. I expected way more from Lidia's. As a regular viewer of the show I was expecting fresh / rustic Italian meals. What I ended up with was stuffed pasta that I'm 95% sure was reheated in a microwave bland mains and slow and inattentive service. The only highlight of the meal was the bread which was the only fresh ingredient used in the entire meal.I was very disappointed with my meal here. I expected way more from Lidia's.
