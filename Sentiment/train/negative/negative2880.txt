Went here on a Monday at around 7:00.  The bar was filled with the usual suspects; guys in Brioni suits drinking away the stress unfortunate weather and reality they have to head home to the wives who just dropped 3-5k at pottery barn.The drinks were solid and very fair priced (based on NY and Chicago pricing)  The open(ish) floor plan would accommodate a happy hour very well.  The food on the other hand - absolutely horrible.We had lamb chili prawns ahi chicken (something) and Chorizo.  The 'fusion' southern Spain meets some Japanese influenced small plates works but the execution was deplorable.  Verdict: Drink but avoid the food at all costs...Went here on a Monday at around 7:00.
