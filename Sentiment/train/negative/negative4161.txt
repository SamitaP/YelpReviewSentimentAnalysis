I tried to give this place a chance despite it's reviews. It's not worth it. They were very quick (food ordered and delivered in under 25 minutes). The only thing is my lo mein noodles were way overcooked and didn't have one vegetable in them. The noodles were very bland and almost chewy. My boyfriend's general tso's was less than subpar. The egg roll's didn't even have shrimp in them. Next time I'll listen to the reviews.I tried to give this place a chance despite it's reviews. It's not worth it.
