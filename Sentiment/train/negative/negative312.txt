Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that in my opinion is just OK.  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. Their food is pretty much like their beers forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.I feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite or at least until the Burgatory opens!Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that in my opinion is just OK.
