I've been to Sushi Kim few times over the years and every time I've gone there the food and service hasn't lived to it's reputation of being one of the best Korean restaurant atleat in Pittsburgh.The food is okay.. service is mediocre and staff ... not the friendliest :)So if anyone asks me to recommend a good korean or a sushi place... you can say this will definitely not make the list.I've been to Sushi Kim few times over the years and every time I've gone there the food and service hasn't lived to it's reputation of being one of the best Korean restaurant atleat in Pittsburgh.The food is okay.. service is mediocre and staff ... not the friendliest :)So if anyone asks me to recommend a good korean or a sushi place... you can say this will definitely not make the list.
