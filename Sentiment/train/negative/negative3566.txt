The wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated my party of 4 & it took 25 minutes to get our first beers. Ordered an app & left 25 minutes later the lobster nachos never came which sucked because I was quote excited about those. The place is gross! There was food & trash all over the floor & I watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty. This was confirmed by my wife. Skip this place & go anywhere else in the Strip DistrictThe wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter.
