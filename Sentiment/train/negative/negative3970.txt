The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening or a slow weekday afternoon the service has been poor. The food is average and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich. Redfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the poor service and average food it has a lot to yearn for.The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks...
