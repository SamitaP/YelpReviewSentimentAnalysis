If I had to chose between dining at Roland's again or having to catch running chainsaws that were tossed at me I'd pick dining at Rolands but only by the slimmest of margins.Why on earth did I go back to this restaurant?  Clearly I must not love myself or something.Want to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer?  Dine at Roland's.  The only reason to be at Rolands is to drink there.  they have a pretty decent beer selection.If I had to chose between dining at Roland's again or having to catch running chainsaws that were tossed at me I'd pick dining at Rolands but only by the slimmest of margins.Why on earth did I go back to this restaurant?
