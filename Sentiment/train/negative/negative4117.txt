I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food I've had.  Well this place manages to be worse than it.The place is rather run down.  The buffet was really terrible.  Food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source.  It just wasn't a great environment.  Try something else definitely!I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food I've had.
