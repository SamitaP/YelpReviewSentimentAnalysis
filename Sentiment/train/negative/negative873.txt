To be honest I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par even for bar food the service was awful especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all.To be honest I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.
