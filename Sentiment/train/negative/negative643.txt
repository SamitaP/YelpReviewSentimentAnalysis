The pros:You get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. They have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. The cons:The woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. My pork dumplings were fried only on one side and were raw in the middle. Everything was pretty darn salty. Yeah I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty but this was unacceptably salty. Leftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! If you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy very salty poor excuse for Chinese takeout.The pros:You get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS.
