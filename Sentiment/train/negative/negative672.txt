I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and Italian frites.  The latter which the menu described as fresh cut twice cooked fresh herbs & roasted garlic were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!As a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese caramelized onions and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a nice restaurant?  Classless.Conclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's.I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.
