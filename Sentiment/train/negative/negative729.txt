Never received my order and was left in a bad mood. The driver did not carry GPS for delivery did not know my address which is right in squirrel hill did not listen to me (or did not understand me?) when I tried to give him directions asked me to pick up food from an intersection 0.3 miles away from my apartment in snow and finally yelled at me to cancel my order. Cannot comment about food but whatever experience I had left a bad taste.Never received my order and was left in a bad mood.
