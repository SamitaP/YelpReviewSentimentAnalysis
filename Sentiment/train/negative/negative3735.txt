We went on a Saturday night. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait...but it was likely closer to 45-50 minutes. The food is just average. Nothing special. Didn't seem handmade or anything like that. I thought they were known for their lasagna...so I got that. Blah...average.Service was incredibly slow. I don't think the waiter checked on us once.I probably wouldn't go back.Visited October 2014We went on a Saturday night.
