I always see this place and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich which he loved. I however ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. It was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food and that's my fault but the waitress came by once as I was eating over heard me upset about my food looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning.I always see this place and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant.
