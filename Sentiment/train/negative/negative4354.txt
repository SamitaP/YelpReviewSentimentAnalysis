We finally made it to Lydia's and unfortunately it was disappointing! The olive spreads that come with the bread basket were gritty and tasteless. The lasagne I ordered was flavorless as well. The pasta in the lasagna was a nice texture. My husband ordered the $42 steak he ordered it mid rare and it was a bit over cooked but the issue with the steak was the flavor if a dirty grill. The Tiramisu was very good also the calamari appetizer was terrific. The service was good but she hovered too much for me personally. We also had several drinks....So in the end $180 left a bad taste in my mouth..........We finally made it to Lydia's and unfortunately it was disappointing!
