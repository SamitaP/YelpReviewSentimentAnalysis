I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK.  I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions and their wings were rather small.  I actually liked the wing sauces I tried though (red hot and spicy garlic).  Our server was friendly but not terribly attentive.  I would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth and the quality of the food was OK.Surprisingly lots of vegetarian options.  A vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK.
