Sorry but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all there was no lid on the salad it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage.Sorry but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.
