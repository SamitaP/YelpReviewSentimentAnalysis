The place looks like something from the Godfather - old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling. Complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables. The food was cooked well but lackluster. I got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth. On the plus the staff was very nice and very attentive. Management - you really need to update the place.The place looks like something from the Godfather - old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling.
