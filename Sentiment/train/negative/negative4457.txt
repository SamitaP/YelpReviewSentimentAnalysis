OK here's what you need to know first-- they do not serve raw oysters. Where I'm from you can't call your restaurant an Oyster House without raw oysters served unless you want a good ass whoopin'. Nothing else about this place remotely conveys Oyster House. It's a fried seafood joint that doesn't serve Yuengling nor takes credit cards. We got all of our food on Styrofoam plates with plastic silverware. The waitress stood and watched us eat most of the meal. This particular lady had a substantial moustache and sideburns.  It was unsettling. You also have to pay before being served. The New England Clam Chowder was good.OK here's what you need to know first-- they do not serve raw oysters.
