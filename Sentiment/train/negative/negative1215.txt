Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old cold hard inedible.  Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish. I can't even believe that the server let alone the  chef thought it appropriate to serve. Brought my 2 year old along had to get a high chair I'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one.Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old cold hard inedible.
