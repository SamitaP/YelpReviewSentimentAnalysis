Have mixed Vincent's.  My meal was good (spicy pasta) but service was spotty.  Another in the party had the homemade gnocchi and it was not good at all tastes like dishwater was the quote.  Naw that couldn't happen to homemade gnocchi after a taste I agreed!  Just goes to show it depends on what you order.Oh yea the parking lot very big but some customers parked in the entrance on both sides to make it one lane and of course when we were leaving we noticed that one guy was taping his car where it had be hit.Have mixed Vincent's.
