I will never go back. Besides the gnocchi coming from a vacuum sealed bag they offer a  Pittsburgh Sandwich  they don't know how to make. Served fries on the side and bagged coleslaw. Fries were an afterthought due to the pickle found underneath.  watched a young waiter spill two drinks or e on a customer.  Same waiter after avoiding a table with cash payment waiting for them to leave so he could pocket the change finally got them change as soon as they left he pulled out his wallet and put the tip inside.So unprofessional. Food from a box and under trained staff. Not if they begged would I go back.I will never go back.
