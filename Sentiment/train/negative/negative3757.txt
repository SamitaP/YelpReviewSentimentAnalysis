I came here for my birthday dinner.  I was not impressed at all.  First off we sat at the booth near where the host has his podium.  He seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable.  I did like the nice touch of having my name printed on the menu and service by our waitress was good.  However food wise it was just OK and a bit disappointing.  I of course had filet and I was just so underwhelmed with it.  The flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring.  After this experience I have no desire to ever come to this restaurant again.I came here for my birthday dinner.  I was not impressed at all.
