The food is horrible - how can you serve pasta and marinara sauce and not even toss the pasta in the sauce?  I truly received a pile of watery noodles with a ladle of sauce on top.Actually the name says it all.  While this place has an italian food menu there isn't an italian bone in its body.  You feel as if you are being served italian food from an irish line cook.The restaurant decor was really nice when they last decorated it in 1981 which was also the last time that they updated the menu.The food is horrible - how can you serve pasta and marinara sauce and not even toss the pasta in the sauce?
