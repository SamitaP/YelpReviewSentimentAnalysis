Extremely disappointed.    My wife and I walked into the restaurant to have the hostess tell us that is was open seating.   Okay that's fine..... as we walk to find our table I'm wondering 'why don't the just have a sign there because she wasn't  very friendly nor timely with the direction.'    That said we sat down at a table set up for dining that was nicely presented.   Unfortunately we sat at the table for approximately five minutes without recognition from any employee at the restaurant.   At this point we decided to dine elsewhere.   As we walked out there was still not one bit of attention given again.   The hostess never lifted her head from whatever she was reading.   I think that a sign would have served a much better purpose.   On the back side it could have said thanks for your business .....or lack there of.Extremely disappointed.
