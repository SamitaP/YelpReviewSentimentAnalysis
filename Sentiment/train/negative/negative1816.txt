Too much cheese on their pizzas and the customer service is incredibly poor.  This is nothing new we have been in Brighton Heights for many years.  My husband LOVES their buffalo chicken pizza but after his last experience waiting over an hour for pick up we would only order from Chubby's if every other local pizza joint was closed.Too much cheese on their pizzas and the customer service is incredibly poor.
