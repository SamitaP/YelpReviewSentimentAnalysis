Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium which it certainly was NOT. When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad yes I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared. I have to say I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same.Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium which it certainly was NOT.
