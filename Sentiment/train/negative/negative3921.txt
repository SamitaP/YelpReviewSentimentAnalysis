There are much better sushi choices available.  This place is just okay but I like sushi to be spectacular.  The employees were lots of fun they had the best sense of humor and the service was excellent. The prices were very good.I was there on a Monday so I just tried the sushi.  I might go back for the Korean BBQ.There are much better sushi choices available.  This place is just okay but I like sushi to be spectacular.
