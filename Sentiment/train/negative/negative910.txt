I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  I also should have known that I shouldn't have cheated on my diet.I figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty looked tasty and yes it even tasted tasty.  Iceberg lettuce grape tomatoes cucumbers red onions french fries popcorn chicken and three types of cheese.  I have to say that even though I was saying yes my body was saying 'OH hell no!'I'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort.  Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now.  Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.I'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.
