DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation we didn't  and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure.DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.
