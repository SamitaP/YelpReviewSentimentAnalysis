We just ate there on a Friday night and the whole experience was a disaster. Rude unfriendly just a miserable male server. Drinks were lousy  service was lousy food just o.k. nothing to write home about and at 9:00 on a Friday night they were putting chairs on the tables and vacuuming hinting it was time for us to leave. The whole experince was horrible... and the bill was outrageous.  Save your money and Go somewhere else!!!!We just ate there on a Friday night and the whole experience was a disaster.
