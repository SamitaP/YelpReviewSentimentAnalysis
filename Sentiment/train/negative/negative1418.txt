The menu online gives no prices and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal but far too much food and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out.The menu online gives no prices and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal but far too much food and nothing extraordinary.
