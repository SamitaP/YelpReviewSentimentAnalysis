My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went looked at the menu and did not find anything Portuguese on the menu. Why does this restaurant promote itself as Portuguese fly the Portuguese flag and not have ANY Portuguese dishes. We left.My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal.
