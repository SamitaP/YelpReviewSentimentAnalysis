Came here a year or so ago to meet some friends... overall not a good experience.  There were 4 of us and I don't think one plate was cleared or drinks refilled it was a slow weeknight as well.  So yes that could have just been bad luck with the waitress but food is sub-par and atmosphere is well.I suppose this is a good dining option in some situations but there are so many other places in the area and I guess this was just nothing to write home about for me.Came here a year or so ago to meet some friends... overall not a good experience.
