Rotten food and over charging customer.I was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant but was greatly disappointed. The restaurant charged me 20% premium over prices on online menu (I ordered takeout) denied there are prices online. The maitre D was reluctant to show the printed menu which is 10% more expensive than online led me to think the over charge was deliberate. The crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from ROTTEN crab. Since I didn't have time to walk 10min one way to return the food it had to be thrown away.   A lunch over charged and wasted.Rotten food and over charging customer.I was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant but was greatly disappointed.
