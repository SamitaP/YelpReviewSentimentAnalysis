one of my favorite places to go in pittsburgh with friends. good place to chill eat drink and watch the game and maybe some pool afterwards. the food is not bad they have pretty good deals for those who are on a budget. dollar burger night where you build your own burger is fun but the patties can be dry sometimes so remember to get them sauced. iceberg wedge salad is a good salad to have the wings arent as good as you would like i had tried the spicy killer ones and didnt even have to drink water. but overall its a nice place to go because it's cleaner than most bars you will go and it serves better food than other places as well.one of my favorite places to go in pittsburgh with friends. good place to chill eat drink and watch the game and maybe some pool afterwards. the food is not bad they have pretty good deals for those who are on a budget. dollar burger night where you build your own burger is fun but the patties can be dry sometimes so remember to get them sauced. iceberg wedge salad is a good salad to have the wings arent as good as you would like i had tried the spicy killer ones and didnt even have to drink water. but overall its a nice place to go because it's cleaner than most bars you will go and it serves better food than other places as well.
