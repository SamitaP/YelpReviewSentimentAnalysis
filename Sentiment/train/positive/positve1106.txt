Not sure what really needs to be added about this restaurant; it is very very good (my favorite in Pittsburgh) but by far not inexpensive. The best thing you can do and I am not sure if it has been touched on in previous reviews is join the Big Burrito group mailing list; you will receive a free coupon for an entrée around your birthday to be used within a certain time period...makes it a really good deal. Oh their wine menu is ridiculously overpriced...call up to find out their current corking fee (I think around $15 bucks) and bring a better bottle at a better price than you are willing to spend there.Not sure what really needs to be added about this restaurant; it is very very good (my favorite in Pittsburgh) but by far not inexpensive.
