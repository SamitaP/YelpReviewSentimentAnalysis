Went here for the brunch prix-fixe menu- such a good deal! Drink appetizer and main course all for $24. First we got a pastry basket with mini-scones croissants and biscuits. I told myself I would eat half of each to try everything but they were too tasty to resist! For appetizer I got the granola and berries and my friend got the creamy polenta. Both were great options! The granola did not taste like anything you get in a box- could definitely tell it was made in-house. The creamy polenta was so different and delicious- will get that next time I go back. Was pretty full by this point but that didn't stop me from completing my  main course! I got the Casbah Benedict with Smoked Salmon and my friend has the Tuscan Eggs. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and were stuffed by the end!Went here for the brunch prix-fixe menu- such a good deal! Drink appetizer and main course all for $24.
