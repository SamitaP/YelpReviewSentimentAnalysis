I had about half a day to kill in Pittsburgh and this is where I ended up. Traveling with food restrictions for any reason can be quite difficult these days and Quiet Storm was a sanctuary for me to just sit down and have an awesome vegan meal without worry of going into anaphylaxis.I had a bowl of something-something with I think tahini sauce and veggies and a huge thing of hot tea (I had laryngitis and was just very very sick so I can't recall much other than how good my food and tea was) and my fiancee had a sandwich that came with some chips and really really really good salsa!The restaurant is just down the street from the Children's Hospital and I'm just really glad my fiancee found this place so I could eat safely without worry.I had about half a day to kill in Pittsburgh and this is where I ended up.
