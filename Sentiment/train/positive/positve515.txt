I like this Eat'n Park. Even though it is a chain not all of them are created equal. The wait staff and kitchen staff really make a big difference in whether or not an Eat'n Park is worth patronizing.  Eating here I change my mentality a bit. I always order the seven dollar BBQ burger with the salad bar add on for two dollars. In my mind I always see myself ordering the seven dollar salad bar with a two dollar hamburger. When the salad bar is kept stocked it has some really good and fresh items. I love that they have spinach and not just iceburg lettuce. I wish other Eat'n Parks were more like this one.I like this Eat'n Park. Even though it is a chain not all of them are created equal.
