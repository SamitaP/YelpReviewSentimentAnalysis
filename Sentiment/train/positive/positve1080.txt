I've eaten at Casbah four times since my first review - from cocktails and an appetizer to lunch everything has exceeded my expectations and the service has been great every time: polite helpful recommendations and my glass is never empty. I continue to think that the Piccola Gusta lunch menu is a real value and has some really delicious options but I would have dinner just to try those little candies they offer at the end of meal at dinnertime again - they are a cross between maple sugar and caramel so good they're worth a star all by themselves.I've eaten at Casbah four times since my first review - from cocktails and an appetizer to lunch everything has exceeded my expectations and the service has been great every time: polite helpful recommendations and my glass is never empty.
