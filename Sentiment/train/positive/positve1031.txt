Went here for bruch and had their take on the classic eggs benedict.  I'm a huge eggs benedict fan and this was very good.  I opted for the prociuto as the meat option and I'm glad I did.  It gave the eggs enough flavor without having to add extra salt.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked and the fruit was tasty as well.  Had the bellini and didn't realize how I much I would enjoy it so I had two!Went here for bruch and had their take on the classic eggs benedict.  I'm a huge eggs benedict fan and this was very good.
