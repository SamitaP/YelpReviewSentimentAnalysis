A taste of CA in PA.  We walked in and I would swear I was in Santa Monica or Hermosa  beach.  Great atmosphere- creative menu and delicious food.  The steak was to die for and the pumpkin cheesecake finished it off.  They also have a nice wine list.  The French Chardonnay was quite good!Thanks for making me feel at home.A taste of CA in PA.
