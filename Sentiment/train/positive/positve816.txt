Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe but this place is certainly competitive. French Press Drip espresso or pour over? You name it they've got it. Only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. If it is just coffee you want you this is the place. It is it a bit snobbish sure but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh.Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe but this place is certainly competitive.
