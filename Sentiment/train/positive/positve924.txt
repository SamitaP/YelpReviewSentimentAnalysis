I happen to stumble upon Jimmy Tsang's while up in Pittsburgh visiting. I must say the food is REALLY good. The service was great - but I only had a drink there with my boyfriend and we got take out. We liked it so much we got take out for my family 2 nights later. The woman that runs the front is very nice / sociable and likes to talk about each dish. She has great suggestions for your taste. Her husband is the chef (they are both from Korea) and he has been cooking as head chef in restaurants for over 20 years. If you like Chinese food you will love this place. It also has two cool bars inside. I highly recommend this place. The reason why I give it 4 stars is because we got take out - not sure how table service is but I'm sure it would be good with the nice people working there.... A must try! I bet it would be a cool first date kind of place....I happen to stumble upon Jimmy Tsang's while up in Pittsburgh visiting. I must say the food is REALLY good.
