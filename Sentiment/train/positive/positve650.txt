Arby's is definitely king of the fast food joints on the Blvd.  For that I'd give it five stars.  However it's still fast food which explains the mediocre rating.  Do not go here without a coupon from the Sunday paper--there's a whole page of them at least once a month.  The staff here is very nice and very fast and on the whole the food is better than elsewhere by the river if you're stuck with a fast food choice.Arby's is definitely king of the fast food joints on the Blvd.  For that I'd give it five stars.
