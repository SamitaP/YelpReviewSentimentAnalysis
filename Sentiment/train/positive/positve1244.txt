Like other vegan reviewers I very much enjoyed the wide range of options. I always feel spoiled when I have actual choices. The food was very good and I will definitely go back again. It is not really exceptional ... I did not have a 'how did they do that?' moment. Someday veggie-vegan restaurants will not have to make food that looks like omnivore grub but this place fills a very important niche for now.  I like the vegetarian-vegan mix because my wife could also enjoy her eggs with cheese (she is not a vegan but eats vegetarian a lot). On the service ... we had  a very nice waitperson who was very helpful without making a nuisance of herself ... which is our ideal.Like other vegan reviewers I very much enjoyed the wide range of options.
