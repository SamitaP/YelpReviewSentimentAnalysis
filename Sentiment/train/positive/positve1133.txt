Food is tasty though portions are for the waifish hipster types. Location is inconvenient and I would not recommend people walking by themselves at night on that stretch of Penn. Service is very uneven i.e. bad even when the place is practically dead. I can't really speak on the coffee though they do have good tissanes(however getting them to refill your hot water is another thing).**************Okay I won't change my rating but I take back what I said about the food. They have changed the menu and it is really bad. We had Buffalo Tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. I had the Thai Peanut Tofu Wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. I don't understand the point of Mockamole? It's made with peas instead of avocado. How to describe the food... it's as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste. Gee peas are green just like avocados?? I would go there for coffee/tea or whatever to hang out but not for the food. Okay there was one decent thing on the menu which was the artichoke dip. I was completely disappointed.Food is tasty though portions are for the waifish hipster types.
