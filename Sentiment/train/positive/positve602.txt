Marges is tucked away in the delightful Pittsburgh neighborhood of Mckees Rocks. This place reminds me half of a diner from the 1950's and half my grandmas kitchen.The seating room is accommodation the service prompt and courteous.The prices are fantastic and so is the food.I had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage potatoes eggs and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. It was excellent. Ladies and Gents I can put food away  like a champ and I still had leftovers.My friend had a succulent buttery French Toast. Simple but they nailed it.I would return.Marges is tucked away in the delightful Pittsburgh neighborhood of Mckees Rocks.
