You gotta love co-ops. Especially this one! It embraces its east end neighborhood makes amazing products available to the community and in general feels like it cares which is the only acceptable vibe for anything calling itself a cooperative! I mostly go here for the juices honestly but I'll tell you why: EEFC is literally the only place in Pittsburgh proper to get your hands on some straight non-pastuerized juicer juice. Why is this not a thing here?! Even the Whole Foods is lacking a juice bar!! Seems juice is the new Pittsburgh Mexican food. Sheesh!
