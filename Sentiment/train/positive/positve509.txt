I got a cheese pizza delivery from here once and I feel like...it's one of those places where it's okay and if that's what someone put in front of me I would eat it but I definitely wouldn't go OMG let's eat there!It was just boring to me. (And I love cheese pizza!)But some of my coworkers like to eat here on occasion so maybe some of their other stuff is better. I wouldn't know.I got a cheese pizza delivery from here once and I feel like...it's one of those places where it's okay and if that's what someone put in front of me I would eat it but I definitely wouldn't go OMG let's eat there!It was just boring to me.
