I love quiet storm! I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. The country burrito is BOMB! So good there has to be crack in the gravy. I also enjoy the tahini queso I often add it to my burrito. It's best on the nachos. For around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. They also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait but completely worth it. The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! Last time I was there it was all Neil Young! Accompanied my burrito perfectly! I definitely recommend this place to vegans & NON-vegans alike!I love quiet storm! I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine.
