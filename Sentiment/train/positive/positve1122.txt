I enjoyed my previous experiences at Casbah but this past weekend was a disappointment. Despite having a reservation well in advance my husband and I were seated at a horrible table right next to the hallway that leads to the kitchen and bathrooms. There was a constant stream of distractions. Service was also really slow and my sea bass was bland. I expected better from Casbah...I enjoyed my previous experiences at Casbah but this past weekend was a disappointment.
