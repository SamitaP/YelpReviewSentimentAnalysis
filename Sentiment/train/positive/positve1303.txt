There is nothing like this in chicago!  (that I know of).....I hope I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  I love the bulk section especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  Super convenient for travelers.  You can buy pasta granolla flour quinoa cous cous cane sugar spices YERBA MATE!!! dried fruit nuts olive oil peanut & almond butter soap.....man I could go on & on.  You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.  I was suprised that they had cacao powder for such a small place.  They have a nice little section of tofu tempeh & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.  They also have a juice bar & vegetarian cafe.  I don't think I'd call it a cafe more like buffet.  I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked but I'm not going to penalize them for that.  For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  I really want to try something from their juice bar too!!  There must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  Everyone was very curteous and nice.  I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town.
