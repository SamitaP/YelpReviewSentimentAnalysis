I went on a date with my girlfriend here and it was a great experience.  Charming outside dining area with excellent service and a knowledgeable staff.  I will say that the food was a bit overpriced but that's to be expected in Shadyside.  Great selection of fresh seafood - I had the salmon and it was delicious.  Reasonably priced wine list as well. I would recommend Casbah for a special event or if you're rolling in the $$.I went on a date with my girlfriend here and it was a great experience.
