I just came here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer and I have to admit that I was pretty satisfied with what we got.  Though I couldn't find any fried pickles or onion rings on the apps section there were some blue cheese nachos that really hit the spot.  The atmosphere of this seems pretty cool especially in the pub area.I just came here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer and I have to admit that I was pretty satisfied with what we got.
