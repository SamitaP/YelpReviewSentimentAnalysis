I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well. I prefer the bar seating as to the dining room but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos. Nachos nachos nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers chili and salads. Really...I don't think I've had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer. This is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good but I'm stuck to the beer selection. They have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week. Service is always great whether there are two or 10 of us.I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well.
