Surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight.   First time at this location.  Great service but wasn't hard to do.....Had a combination Orange Shrimp and Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice.  It was typical PF Changs (Very good).  You can get the Fried Rice off the kids menu for $2.95 versus $8 for a big bowl off the regular menu.Surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight.
