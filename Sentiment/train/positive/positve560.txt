Love this place - they were very accommodating to me Peanut and Gramma (she goes often).  Solid wine selection and Gramma says they make a good Margarita.  We all enjoyed all of our food as well.  Great view of the Mon too.Love this place - they were very accommodating to me Peanut and Gramma (she goes often).  Solid wine selection and Gramma says they make a good Margarita.
