I just found this place a month back and I'm kind of blown away by how awesome it is. Fresh produce awesome prepared salads and dips bulk everything natural cleaners and plenty of hippie garbage you can't help but fill your shelves with. The best part is that they try to stock up with locally sourced produce milk and meat. And you can get a good discount if you purchase stock in the co-op.
