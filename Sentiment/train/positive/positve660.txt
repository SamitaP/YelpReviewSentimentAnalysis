I had one of the breakfast specials and it was fantastic. There was also a continuous flow of coffee which is always nice. Probably just missed the church crowd so it wasn't too busy either. Definitely a good breakfast spot.I had one of the breakfast specials and it was fantastic. There was also a continuous flow of coffee which is always nice.
