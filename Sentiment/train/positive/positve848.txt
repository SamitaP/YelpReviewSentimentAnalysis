Great Pittsburgh Happy Hour! $5 dollar apps and dollar off tap beers.They have a wide selection of draft beers so if you like to enjoy flavors other than Miller Light this is a great place to go and enjoy some IPAs at a good price.Wide selection of $5 apps too. We ordered the BBQ Nachos and they were amazzzing with multiple z's! I crave them all the time now.Great service too. Our server was happy and excited to be there. She made the atmosphere more fun.Get there :)Great Pittsburgh Happy Hour! $5 dollar apps and dollar off tap beers.They have a wide selection of draft beers so if you like to enjoy flavors other than Miller Light this is a great place to go and enjoy some IPAs at a good price.Wide selection of $5 apps too.
