As a displaced west-coaster I appreciate a store like this in Pittsburgh. I like the bulk goods and spices because you can take as much as you need you get the spices whole and they put them in big jars so you can sniff them if you want before you buy (the downside to that is that every time the jars get opened the spices probably lose some oils) and there's a huge selection. This place has my quinoa pearled barley spelt flour and nutritional yeast. Some of the vegetables pop out at me and I'm tempted to buy a lemon or some really ripe piece of fruit. Usually I don't though. During the summer they were selling fresh herbs in pots. That was really tempting. Once they sold kittens. That was amazing. It doesn't hurt that its right by the climbing wall fencing gymnastics and bike shop.As a displaced west-coaster I appreciate a store like this in Pittsburgh.
