They have these tofu tenders which are akin to a vegan buffalo wing.  I can't put my finger on it as there really doesn't appear to be much to them in terms of some sort of secret cooking technique but holy crap I can't get enough of them!  I had 3 orders in 2 days and since it's tofu & not some greasy wings... it's a legitimately healthy meal/snack.The Cheesy Snake -- a vegetarian cheese steak -- can be made with vegan cheese and it's pretty slammin too.  The slaw tastes like liking a brick of salt and the coffee etiquette -- pouring old pots into other half-full pots -- leaves a bit to be desired but overall I know that it's one of a few places in Pittsburgh that serves vegan food that's pretty awesome.They have these tofu tenders which are akin to a vegan buffalo wing.
