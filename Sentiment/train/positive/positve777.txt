I would never have found this place if it wasn't for yelp.  It is somewhat hidden among lots of houses and residential buildings.  I ordered a latte and blueberry scone both were great!  I wanted to order food but I was told that they do not serve food (even breakfast) until 11 a.m.  I would go back if i am in the area.I would never have found this place if it wasn't for yelp.
