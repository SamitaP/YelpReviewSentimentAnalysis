Wonderful! Lovely! Quaint! One of the most refreshing cafe's in pittsburgh! My visit was a 'surprise' from my boyfriend who knows how much I appreciate fine espresso. I was instantly enamored with the set-up inside and the pleasant nature of the individuals who greeted us behind the counter. The baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadn't come to our senses. I ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream (I believe the whipped cream was homemade as well.... simply to die for) and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft. My boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in Italy over his 2 week visit with family this past summer. Now if that isn't representative of a solid job in bringing a European Cafe to the States then I don't know what is!Wonderful! Lovely! Quaint! One of the most refreshing cafe's in pittsburgh!
