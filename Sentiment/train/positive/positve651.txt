This is one of the true sleepers of neighborhood Pittsburgh. Since 1979 this diner/family restaurant has been serving excellent breakfasts and home-cooked dinners. The staff has been there as long.They have some of the best fresh-brewed iced tea in the city. They also have my favorite pancakes. If you're looking for a cheap low key dependable place to go come home at 8 o'clock one evening sit in the window and especially around the holiday season I assure you that it will be one of the best old time meals you'll ever have. I hate its name but I love the Rusty Nail.This is one of the true sleepers of neighborhood Pittsburgh.
