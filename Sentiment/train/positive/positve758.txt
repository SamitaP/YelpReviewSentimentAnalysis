Best independent coffeeshop I've ever had the pleasure to visit.Best americano I've ever had.  Some of the best espresso I've ever had.  Great desserts pastries and cookies.  Good food.  The employees are awesome.The owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  The shop is also all about bicycling as transportation sponsoring regular group rides around town and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined.Best independent coffeeshop I've ever had the pleasure to visit.Best americano I've ever had.
