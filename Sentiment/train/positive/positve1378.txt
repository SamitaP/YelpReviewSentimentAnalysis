My boyfriend and I have gone two years in a row for Valentine's Day to this quaint and intimate restaurant. The decor is beautiful and the epitome of cozy and the waitresses are welcoming and pleasant to talk to. On top if all of that the food was absolutely delicious. If you have the chance get their duck it was perfectly spiced and cooked. Just bring your favorite bottle of wine with and you have the makings of a romantic and pleasantly not wallet-breaking night out.
