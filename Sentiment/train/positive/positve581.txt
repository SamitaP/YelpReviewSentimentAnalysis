We went here for Thanksgiving dinner; we had called ahead to check out vegan options but the person on the other end was a little grumpy about the matter but there's so little open on that day there was little choice except to make sure I ate a big lunch earlier.I ordered the Thai salad which is probably the only vegan item on the menu - really just a coleslaw with a peanut sauce and some funky chips.  I also ordered some grilled vegetables.  Both were good but not amazing. The beer selection was really bad (I mean dive bar stuff) however the slightly pricey wine selection redeemed the place and we had a great red and white.  The service too was pretty good but I simply can't recommend going here due to the poor selection of vegan items.We went here for Thanksgiving dinner; we had called ahead to check out vegan options but the person on the other end was a little grumpy about the matter but there's so little open on that day there was little choice except to make sure I ate a big lunch earlier.I ordered the Thai salad which is probably the only vegan item on the menu - really just a coleslaw with a peanut sauce and some funky chips.
