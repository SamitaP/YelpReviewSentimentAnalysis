I am amazed that people can write negative reviews about Papa J's.   I have been a return customer since the early 90's and the food quality and service are way above average......and especially for this price range.Kudos to management for maintaining such a level of quality and freshness.   Nothing we had tonight was disappointing and we over-ordered because each dish was delectable.The best item tonight was the Mozzarella appetizer cradled in Bread with an authentic marinara.The white pizza with sun-dried tomatoes was as usual out of this world good.   The scallops special appetizer was phenomenal.WE WILL BE BACK.I am amazed that people can write negative reviews about Papa J's.
