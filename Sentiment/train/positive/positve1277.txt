The pizza here is amazing. The crust is crunchy on the outside but not too thin so it's also chewy on the inside.  I always go for pepperoni and mushroom or ham and pineapple. I cannot add much to this review on delivery or other items because I always get pizza for takeout; however I did try the garden salad and wouldn't recommend it if you want more than iceberg with a couple of cucumber slices. Bonus tip: show up early for your takeout to play some pinball! They just swapped in a new one - TRON.The pizza here is amazing.
