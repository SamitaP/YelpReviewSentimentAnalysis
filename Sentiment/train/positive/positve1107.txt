This might be the best food I've had in Pittsburgh.The restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand. The hostess stand is located in the indoor space. We were seated in the outdoor section in a corner which was fairly drafty. This is the only negative point I have about the meal.We ordered the cheese  tasting menu the duck the scallop pasta and the lemon sponge cake. Each bite was perfect -- flavorful and expertly cooked. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. We left feeling full and happy.This might be the best food I've had in Pittsburgh.The restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand.
