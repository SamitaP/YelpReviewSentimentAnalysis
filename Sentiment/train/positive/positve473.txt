The service started out slow but they eventually picked up the pace. We ordered the chicken/lettuce wrap appetizer and we enjoyed it. For the entres we had the fried rice and mongolian beef both of which were delightful. I would not mind going back to explore their menu.The service started out slow but they eventually picked up the pace. We ordered the chicken/lettuce wrap appetizer and we enjoyed it.
