This place was pretty cool.  I mean defiantly felt like a place with a bunch of regulars but i felt welcome inside.  All I got was a cup of coffee and a apple pastry.  My mother got a espresso.  Both drinks were good but for being one of the top rated places on yelp I expected more than what I expirenced. The apple pastry did not seem very fresh but it was still very good and worth eating.  I guess I was just a little disappointed because I expected so much more than what I got.This place was pretty cool.
