I've been to Cafe Zinho at least 25 times and I am sure to go back again soon.  The dining room is a funky garage space that has been converted into an eclectic Europen bistro.  The food is very good and the atmosphere is relaxed and Bohemian.  The puff pastry appetizer is always a winner.  The chef Tony Pais is Portuguese but there are a lot of elements of French cuisine in his cooking. He used to own Cafe Zao and Baum Vivant both well regarded restaurants but I find the food is much more reasonable at Zinho. There's a few tables outside and I find it enjoyable to choose those tables on a warm day.
