I like the Quiet Storm because it offers food as well as drinks.  The spinach artichoke dip and white pita pizza is good.  I never had a Chai Milkshake until I went to the quiet storm.  If you can deal with East End urbanites then I would suggest trying it out if nothing for a good laugh and decent food.I like the Quiet Storm because it offers food as well as drinks.
