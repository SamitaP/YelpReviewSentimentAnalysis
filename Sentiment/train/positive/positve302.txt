Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected the bar was lively the food was good and the service was accommodating  The beers are better than Church Brew Works and the bar was populated.  The bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.  I vote for Rock Bottom as the anchor store of the Water Works.Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.
