The lobster rolls were delicious the blackened fish tacos were light and flaky not too spicy and had a nice salsa.  The white sangria was very refreshing and not too alcoholic.  The outdoor view of the river was really enjoyable and the service was quick.The lobster rolls were delicious the blackened fish tacos were light and flaky not too spicy and had a nice salsa.
