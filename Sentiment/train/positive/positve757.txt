Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor with dark rich colors and textures and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is bar none the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich thick potent without being sour or bitter with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather but are always fantastic.The coffee is also terrific and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.In addition they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert and don't know their supplier but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.All that and it's a lovely center of community where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor with dark rich colors and textures and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space.
