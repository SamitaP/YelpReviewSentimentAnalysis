If you find yourself craving pizza on a Saturday night you can't beat $9 for a large cheese pizza. I also enjoy the hoagies as they are lightly toasted for a nice crunch.I can't speak for the pastas or appetizers but the Pittsburgh style grilled chicken salad is a dependable choice.If you find yourself craving pizza on a Saturday night you can't beat $9 for a large cheese pizza.
