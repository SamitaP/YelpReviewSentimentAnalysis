I'm a vegetarian so a lot of times I have to just settle for an Italian-no meat or a lack-luster veggie only sub... but the Mediterranean at Pizza Perfectta is by far the best sub/hoagie I have ever ordered from a pizza place. Garlicky not too soggy great cheese and flavorful toppings- I LOVE IT. I can't speak to any other hoagie because it's the only one I get. 5 stars everybody.I'm a vegetarian so a lot of times I have to just settle for an Italian-no meat or a lack-luster veggie only sub... but the Mediterranean at Pizza Perfectta is by far the best sub/hoagie I have ever ordered from a pizza place.
