Quiet storm is a really cool vegetarian restaurant. The time I was there the service was fine and the food was unique. Their menu is a limited on the weekdays your best bet is one of their many quesadillas.I'm not as concerned about the preservation of vibe and atmosphere as long as the food still tastes good. I was in love with the pierogidilla and happy to leave the table feeling full without having any meat.I wrote a review of Quiet Storm on my web site Binge! http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/07/07/ive-got-an-itch-for-kitsch-quiet-storm-in-bloomfield/Quiet storm is a really cool vegetarian restaurant.
