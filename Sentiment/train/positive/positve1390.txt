This is a cozy little place. I made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening because the restaurant we were supposed to go to  closed due to an emergency. Major bummer for us but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved a request they graciously accomodated. Unfortunately we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. Fortunately we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up.OK so now let's talk about the wine thing: this is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee but it they do it's a small fee.Now for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. The bread was also really delicious very fresh and soft. For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful. We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse which my partner didn't love but I thought it was pretty good definitely not the best I've had but good!To sum it all up: good food cozy place and friendly staff!
