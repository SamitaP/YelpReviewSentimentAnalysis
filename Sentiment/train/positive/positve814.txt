What a great find! I frequent the nearby Bryant street restaurants but did not even know this place existed until a friend of mine brought took me here today for hot chocolate. I immediately fell in love it. The baristas were very friendly and my hot chocolate was great! There were also some incredibly delicious-looking pastries which I will need to go back soon to try. There was a nice ambience - it was quiet but not uncomfortable so. It would be a great place to study read or visit with friends.You should expect to wait a few minutes for your drink but it is well worth it :-)What a great find!
