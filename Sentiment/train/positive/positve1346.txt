East End Food Co-op is awesome!If I had to choose between the Co-op and WF the Co-op is where it's at.There is a good selection of fruits and veggies as well as toiletries (shampoos soaps toothpaste tampons shaving creams etc.) to household cleaning products. The frozen section is also very diverse with a good selection of frozen meals ice cream (dairy and nondairy) and veggies. The Co-op also carries a nice selection of foods for people with restricted diets especially for Celiac and vegans or for people with severe allergies like myself. They also carry hard to find vegan cheeses such as Treeline that I have difficulty finding at WF in Pittsburgh and the Co-op in West Virginia. I was also happy to find that they had my favorite Ito-En sencha green tea shot (it's just green tea in a can it's not like one of those energy shots at all). The deli is also fantastic and I highly recommend the Co-op deli over the WF deli. There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really really really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads vegan pesto noodle salad etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good Co-op they have a variety of non-dairy milk options. If you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent place to get a quick meal (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live. There is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events classes pet sitting etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store.
