I'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies. Their nachos is pretty good. I also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they're good as well. I think the only thing I did't like is the steak taco appetizer. It was too sour and kinda tasteless.I'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies.
