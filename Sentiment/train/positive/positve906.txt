I had some pizza from Pizza Parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  A colleague brought it in so I didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  I had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  Nothing special nothing especially good or bad.  Crust sauce cheese pepperoni fin.  It was a little greasy and quite cheesy as well.  I was starving so I really enjoyed it but I think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  Still for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner I'd say go for it.  Just don't have very high expectations.I had some pizza from Pizza Parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  A colleague brought it in so I didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.
