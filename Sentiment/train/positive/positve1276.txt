I've never actually been to the restaurant but despite the plethora of pizza joints in the area (and believe me we've sampled a LOT) this is the only place from which my Partner In Cuisine and I will order hoagies.  Even when they got our order wrong once they were quick to fix it and deliver the replacements within a few minutes.  I can honestly say that the many times we have ordered from Pizza Perfectta we have never actually had the pizza (but I hear it's good).  We just keep gravitating back to those hoagies!I've never actually been to the restaurant but despite the plethora of pizza joints in the area (and believe me we've sampled a LOT) this is the only place from which my Partner In Cuisine and I will order hoagies.
