The food here is good but it is not exceptional.  I've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. There is the typical Asian fare such as General Tso's fried rice noodles stuffed shrimp and dumplings. There is also American macaroni and cheese home fries and ham. When I go to China Garden I always request a carry out container as I find it nauseating to sit in the dining area and see other patrons pile their plates with astonishing heaps of food. One thing for sure is that China Garden gets plenty of customers.Definitely come here for a reasonably priced buffet!The food here is good but it is not exceptional.
