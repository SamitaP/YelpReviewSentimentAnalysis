Wednesday is Wing night i.e. eat your face off night. For ~ $9 you can eat unlimited wings (with your choice of various sauces) for several hours. If you can top it off with a brownie - they're quite good.I've mostly had the wings at Blues & I like all of the sauces but the burgers are good as well. Whatever you do make sure to get the sweet potato fries & tip your waitress! (Especially if her name is Meg).Wednesday is Wing night i.e. eat your face off night.
