I'm not really into chain restaurants but my mom's in town so.... You know. The mains are basically a half notch classier than a Chinese take out but I'm just not impressed. $15 for a small portion of orange chicken that is about as good as a cheap takeout seems silly. Where I think the restaurant really underwhelms is the soups and salads I know it isn't the focus of the restaurant but the lunch sides that precede the lunch entrees are just bad. The salad lacks any creativity and the soup was just a bowl of salty beef water.I'm not really into chain restaurants but my mom's in town so.... You know.
