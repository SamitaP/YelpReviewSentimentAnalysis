You know what's good? Tomato-basil soup with cream in it.  And even better? Finding a way to eat on the patio in January. Where the dining room at Casbah is intimate and warm the patio is bright open and shielded from the elements. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful and the lunch specials were actually special - good flavor slightly indulgent but you don't leave feeling overstuffed. I want to eat my way through the menu.You know what's good? Tomato-basil soup with cream in it.  And even better? Finding a way to eat on the patio in January.
