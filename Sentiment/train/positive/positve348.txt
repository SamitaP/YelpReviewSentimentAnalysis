BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. I came to rock bottom looking for a great beer. Full of hops that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel with a jalapeño cheese dip. I was blown away the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom keep up the good work.BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. I came to rock bottom looking for a great beer. Full of hops that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction.
