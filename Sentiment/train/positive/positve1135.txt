I've been to the Quiet Storm a couple of times for brunch-type meals and have always been pleased.  Their extensive veggie/vegan geared menu is for the most part really healthy and fairly light...but it's not without its crave-worthy items like smashed potatoes with cheese and my favorite the peanut butter chocolate milkshake...heavenly.  Paired with a hummus and veggie sandwich and green pea 'moc-a-mole' you don't feel so naughty having dessert with brunch.The vibe is mellow and so is the wait staff.  Service is leisurely but not slow.  I look forward to at least one chill breakfast here on my trips to the 'Burgh to visit friends and such.I've been to the Quiet Storm a couple of times for brunch-type meals and have always been pleased.
