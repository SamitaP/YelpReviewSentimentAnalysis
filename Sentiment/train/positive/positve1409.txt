This restaurant was phenomenal.   We went for my wife's 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great experience.  The meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good.  The marinara that came with the meatball was the best I have ever had.Don't go here if you are in a rush because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  But we were there to enjoy the night so we did not care.I would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  If you do  appetizers drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.  But I thought it was well worth it.The wait staff was great.  Our server was Emmett and we had a lot of fun with him.  The owner/chef even came out and chatted with us on the upstairs outdoor patio.
