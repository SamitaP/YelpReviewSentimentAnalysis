Every time I have been to Casbah for lunch brunch or dinner the food has been great and the service has been impeccable.  Sure I've had more exceptionally delicious and unique meals in Pittsburgh but Casbah has Consistent Awesomeness down pat.  Just get a reservation ahead of time.  Also the desserts are mandatory!  The duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness and the long island duck is another great choice.  A nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar.  Try the Boyd & Blair cocktail and the sangria.Every time I have been to Casbah for lunch brunch or dinner the food has been great and the service has been impeccable.
