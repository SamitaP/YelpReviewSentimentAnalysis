Had a great dinner here. The Portuguese corn bread was delicious   The salmon with beet sauce was perfect. We enjoyed our dinner here- cozy and welcoming  atmosphere.  Don't forget dessert we had bread pudding and cookies and cream. We went on Valentines weekend so the price was higher than usual. Also like Byob although they charged 5 dollar corkage fee it is worth it to bring your own choice of wine. There is also fee for sharing plate but again worth it.   Will definitely go again.
