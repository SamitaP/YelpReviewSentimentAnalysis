As if in answer to my prayer.I'm not basing this review on the quality of the coffee. I had Rooibos tea and a (delicious) apple galette. I'm basing this on the fact that I love this style of coffee shop (could be in Seattle or Portland). And the fact that since coming to P'burgh for a few days for the first time it's the first aggregation of non-grumpy people I've been around. Well to be fair all the partying college students on the South Side last night were not grumpy. Maybe it's that the folks sitting around me here at Tozza Doro are just chilling quietly dong whatever they are doing and not being overly grumpy or self absorbed. They don't apear to have more than coffee and pastries but they do have free wireless.There is not as much in this neighborhood as I thought there was going to be but if you find yourself here and you like non-corporate home grown cafes this is a great place to chill.As if in answer to my prayer.I'm not basing this review on the quality of the coffee.
