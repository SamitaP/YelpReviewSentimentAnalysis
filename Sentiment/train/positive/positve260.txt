Its fun but much smaller than some of the others I've visited.  Its clean staff is friendly and its a good way to waste time before a movie. They do have good  food. Gets a 3 stars because I get bored easily at this location.Its fun but much smaller than some of the others I've visited.  Its clean staff is friendly and its a good way to waste time before a movie.
