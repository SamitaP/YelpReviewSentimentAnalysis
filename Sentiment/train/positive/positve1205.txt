Solid vegetarian and vegan food great coffee in a cool atmosphere. What else can you want? I had the breakfast burrito with tofu (the black and gold I believe it's called) and it was quite good. The ambiance is correctly described as hipster and it's exactly what you'd expect from a hipster vegetarian coffee shop/restaurant. Five effing stars.Solid vegetarian and vegan food great coffee in a cool atmosphere. What else can you want?
