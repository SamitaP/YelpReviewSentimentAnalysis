The husband and I get so excited each week for grocery shopping because of the co-op. I love it so much.We need this place in our lives. It gives us hope and makes us feel like we belong. I have never in my entire life eaten better broccoli. I sometimes obsess about this broccoli and go through withdraws when we run out. The beet hummus is to die for and the wraps are incredible. I also like the beauty section and natural makeup and night creams. Yes some stuff can be pricer that Trader Joes's like the Amy's frozen pizzas but it is so worth it becasue you know that the extra $ is going towards a good cause.  We got a membership last year and rarely go anywhere else.  And our dog attacks his bowl when we feed him his food. He won't even go near anything else which we sometimes have to resort to when he runs out.
