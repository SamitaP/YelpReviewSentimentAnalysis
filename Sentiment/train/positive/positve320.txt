I'm not much of a beer drinker but my fiancee is a major enthusiast so I agreed to tag along.  I'm glad I did!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp light and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side which was definitely a good choice.  My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again but if I found myself in the city I may just stop by.I'm not much of a beer drinker but my fiancee is a major enthusiast so I agreed to tag along.
