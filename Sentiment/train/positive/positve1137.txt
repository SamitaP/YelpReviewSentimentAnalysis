I'm not sure how it took my wife & I so long to find this place! Before visiting the Quiet Storm I didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian but that shouldn't be much of a problem even for fans of meat. I ordered the Maelstrom which is a what I would call a Mediterranean Quesadilla. The flavor was subtle but delicious. There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community. The only complaint I would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold as we were sitting by the door... and it was winter. Finally remember to bring enough cash to cover the bill as that's the only way to pay. I was not disappointed by the Quiet Storm and will definitely be getting back to this place next time I'm in Pittsburgh.I'm not sure how it took my wife & I so long to find this place!
