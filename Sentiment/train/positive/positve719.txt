Pretty solid Chinese takeout.  They have a $10 minimum on Campus Food and delivered in less time than expected.  The Szechuan eggplant was not spicy at all but it did have a nice assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli zucchini corn carrots etc.).  The vegetable egg rolls seemed pretty tough - I don't know that I would order them again.Overall I'm pretty pleased.  I already like this place - even the big neon sign that just says Tasty on the storefront.   (This is how I'm going to refer to it - ie Do you want some takeout from Tasty?)  I also love that one of their lunch menu options is fried rice soup & an egg roll for $2.95!  I will almost definitely order from here again.Pretty solid Chinese takeout.
