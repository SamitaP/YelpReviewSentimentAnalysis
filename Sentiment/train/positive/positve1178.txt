I love this place it's the Beehive  Starbucks Eat N Park and every neighborhood coffee shop in America tossed together in one place.Unfortunately on this day we arrived after the kitchen closed but the friendly barista behind the counter offered to make us a drink. I had a soy green tea latte he chose a dirty chai latte made with coffee and tea interesting!My green tea latte was served piping hot in a pint glass not the Shamrock shake colored green tea latte you get at Starbucks this was the color of your father's old white shirt that hasn't been washed in a few weeks. Not as syrupy sweet as Starbucks either but a nice dose of natural brown sugar gave it a nice taste. And it was a nickel cheaper than a Starbucks tall. Good deal!My friend Jamie's dirty chai latte was good again not overly sweet which is ok for him he doesn't have a sweet tooth. Next Sunday we'll go back earlier when the kitchen is open the take out menu looks great healthy low fat and vegan.I love this place it's the Beehive  Starbucks Eat N Park and every neighborhood coffee shop in America tossed together in one place.Unfortunately on this day we arrived after the kitchen closed but the friendly barista behind the counter offered to make us a drink.
