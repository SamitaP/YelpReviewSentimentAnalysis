Based on the menu I would classify Cafe Zinho as more of a general fine dining restaurant rather than a Portuguese specialty restaurant. There are some Portuguese items but I feel the emphasis is on providing high quality dishes non-specific to any particular cuisine.For starters we were brought corn bread which was great. It had a great textural contrast with the flakiness of corn bread along with the fluffiness of loafs.Next we had frog legs in a lemon and white wine sauce. The sauce was very pleasant as it highlighted a contrast among bittery buttery and sweetness. We dipped many pieces of corn bread in the sauce. Most of the flavor of the frog legs came from the sauce. The frog legs themselves were very chewy. I suspect that they were prepared in an oven; I think quickly grilling or quickly deep frying the frog legs might yield a more pleasant texture.The main entree was great! I had the filet of trout which comes with grilled vegetables. The grilled veggies were simple yet well executed. The trout was nicely seasoned and cooked. I was able to appreciate the taste of the fish as well as the light seasoning. I wish the trout's skin was a bit crispier; however I want to emphasis the the fish was cooked very much to my liking.All in all the food was very good. The main entrees were quite pricey. You're likely to be spending at least $30 per person.
