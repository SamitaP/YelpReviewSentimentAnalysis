What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road because I could see myself being a regular here.Honestly these guys have got some talent like real talent.  They can play the piano sing play guitar and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  I am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time I am bringing a big group of friends.What a great time!  This place was awesome!
