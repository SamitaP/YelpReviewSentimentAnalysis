Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey.Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win.
