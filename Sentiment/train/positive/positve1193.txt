You don't have to be a vegetarian or vegan to enjoy Quiet Storm.I've been here for both breakfast and lunch and haven't been disappointed.  The menu has a good selection of both vegetarian and vegan dishes and the specials change daily.The only issue I have had is with service. On a particularly crowded Sunday I asked twice for a coffee refill and the waiter never filled my cup or even checked in after our food came out.  I know it was busy but other tables seemed to be doing just fine.  Despite the poor service I returned and haven't had any problems since.You don't have to be a vegetarian or vegan to enjoy Quiet Storm.I've been here for both breakfast and lunch and haven't been disappointed.
