My favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  All-time favorite dish:  eggplant parmesan with their spicy arrabbiata sauce I had to ask for them to make it that way.  Not your typical layers of fried heavy eggplant--lighter chunkier eggplant that melts in your mouth.  My favorite appetizer there is the sizzling olives--they bring you a little cast iron skillet and throw olives in it--they soften and are so wonderful to eat!  Flavor explodes in your mouth!  Also good is ther roasted veggie platter and charcuterie plate.  We typically go on less crowded days as the restaurant is small--but we've always had excellent service and the food comes out hot and fresh!My favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.
