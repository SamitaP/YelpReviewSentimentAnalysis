Perfect for a quick lunch.I had a New York style cheese pizza that was amazing even the crust was delicious. Easily one of the most simplistic amazing pieces of pizza I've ever had. The Greco piece of pizza I had was also perfect. It was topped with spinach and feta cheese I believe. I was so full after man-handling my second piece of pizza I had to stop eating. But my friend had a half finished piece of Greco just sitting there on the table waiting for me to finish it. It was as if the pizza told me to pick it up and keep nibbling and nibbling . This resulted in some sort of religious full feeling. God himself wanted me to finish that piece of pizza and I listened.Perfect for a quick lunch.I had a New York style cheese pizza that was amazing even the crust was delicious.
