Cute little spot in a sweet neighborhood. Snag a table before ordering and you'll have a great experience. I stopped in for a cappuccino and sandwich. The cappuccino was hot and satisfying (good quality beans strong). and the vegetable panini adequate (I'm not the biggest fan of artichoke leaves).Good spot for reading a book and eavesdropping on strangers' conversations.Cute little spot in a sweet neighborhood.
