The Cajun Pasta I ordered was just spicy enough to keep me sipping my Rock Bottom IPA. It may be a chain but I always get that microbrew restaurant feel when I'm here. They could upgrade the quality of the servers but I've never had a really bad experience with the service.The Cajun Pasta I ordered was just spicy enough to keep me sipping my Rock Bottom IPA.
