This is a great stop for fresh everything! I crave their juice on a regular basis. Shot of kale YES! The salad bar and hot foods bar are also great hot foods change on a regular basis but always have vegan/veg options. Aside from a quick dinner/grocery shopping location we tried their weekend brunch. My bf loved everything and the prices were great for a full plate of food. I myself devoured some vegan pumpkin bread and a delicious fair-trade coffee. I also love their to-go foods selection full of vegan-friendly wraps salads and more - great for picnics! The staff is very friendly and it's obvious they like their jobs. The bulk foods and produce sections are also impressive! I wish it was closer but it's worth the commute!
