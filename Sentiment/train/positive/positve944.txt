Great great for parties and celebrations of all kinds.  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list.  The Food is creative and many of the items are organic or locally grown.  Everything is so fresh and pretty you almost don't want to eat it.  The wine list is extensive and although it can be pricey they have great happy hour specials.Great great for parties and celebrations of all kinds.
