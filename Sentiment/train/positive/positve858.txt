This review is on lunch at Buffalo Blues. I have been here a number of times for dinner and for late-night drinks and have always thought it was a great place to grab a drink and watch a game but haven't been overly impressed with the food. That is until yesterday. I came in for a quick bite to eat and ordered the Hot Veggie sandwich. It was FANTASTIC - the best veggie sandwich I have had here in Pittsburgh. Other than that service was good and fairly quick. I made have found my new go-to lunch spot!This review is on lunch at Buffalo Blues.
