Stopped in without a reservation around 7 pm. I ordered the house soup. It was very yummy. The soup was a tomato based soup with noodles and chick peas. I also tried the sausage flatbread. The flatbread sizing easily fed one. My boyfriend shared with me. The tomato sauce and peppers on it really made the flatbread. I really one to come back int the summer when the front windows are opened and enjoy some wine and small dishesaStopped in without a reservation around 7 pm. I ordered the house soup.
