i'm giving this place a solid 3. i've had better cheap chinese and i've had worse. first off let me just say take out is probably the way to go. our server was nearly impossible to understand and we drank water out of tiny styrofoam cups that we had to wait for her to refill.i ordered the crab rangoon a shrimp springroll and chicken fried rice. the rangoon was pretty good the springroll was just a clump of grease and the rice was good. my friends ordered beef and broccoli an egg roll and general tso's. they were not too impressed with their meals.as far as food this place seems to be pretty hit or miss. the prices make it worth ordering take out or delivery but i wouldn't waste my time eating in here.i'm giving this place a solid 3. i've had better cheap chinese and i've had worse. first off let me just say take out is probably the way to go. our server was nearly impossible to understand and we drank water out of tiny styrofoam cups that we had to wait for her to refill.i ordered the crab rangoon a shrimp springroll and chicken fried rice. the rangoon was pretty good the springroll was just a clump of grease and the rice was good. my friends ordered beef and broccoli an egg roll and general tso's. they were not too impressed with their meals.as far as food this place seems to be pretty hit or miss. the prices make it worth ordering take out or delivery but i wouldn't waste my time eating in here.
