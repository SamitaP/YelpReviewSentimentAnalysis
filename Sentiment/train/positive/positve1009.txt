I came here a year ago and had a really awesome meal.  I'd say the best in Pittsburgh I'd had since arriving.  Given that we went here for a birthday dinner.Overall we were all left with kind of a meh experience.  Our server seemed pretty disinterested and slow.  I think the low point was someone ordered a steak medium rare (for $38).  What came out was a well done and COLD piece of meat.  It looked like a hockey puck. When he sent it back no apology...and no change in the bill.  I at least expected a manager or someone to come out and apologize and say We've taken it off the bill or SOMETHING.  Nope.  He sat there watching the rest of us finish our entrees before his replacement steak arrived.The rest of the entrees were good and I would go back.  But probably with lowered expectations.I came here a year ago and had a really awesome meal.  I'd say the best in Pittsburgh I'd had since arriving.
