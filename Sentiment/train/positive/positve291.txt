The beer is good. Their light beer Lumpy Dog is very good-- doesn't taste like a light beer. When I was pregnant I became quite a fan of their root beer floats too.As others have noted the pretzels are really good. I'm not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. Veggie burgers are always good too though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order say the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. Long long ago when I used to go to the Rock Bottom in Boston there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that I will gladly add another star!The beer is good.
