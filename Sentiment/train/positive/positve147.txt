The food is good and its CHEAP.I mean REALLY INEXPENSIVE.$4.00 for a burger and fries. Add a coke and its like $10.00-$13.00 for two people.  Seldom if ever crowded. Service can be a tad slow but hit or miss.They also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and park.Try the shakes they're great.The food is good and its CHEAP.I mean REALLY INEXPENSIVE.$4.00 for a burger and fries.
