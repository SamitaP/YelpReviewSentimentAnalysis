We've all had this happen to us - you go past a place one hundred times and never go on. Then once you finally do you realize how many opportunities you wasted!Rock Bottom is definitely a solid bar. As a microbrewery their beer list is full of house brews. There are better beers in the world but there are a lot of worse beers out there too. What really makes Rock Bottom standout though is the food. My girlfriend and I shared an order of nachos and it took everything we had to finish them. They also make a mean soft pretzel. The Waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in Pittsburgh but no trip to the Waterfront is complete without a bite and a drink at Rock Bottom.We've all had this happen to us - you go past a place one hundred times and never go on.
