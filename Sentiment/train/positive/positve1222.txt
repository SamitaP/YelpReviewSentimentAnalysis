I've been introduced to their kale offerings and must admit I'm a huge fan. There's a kale salad that you can ask them to put in a wrap and it's absolutely phenomenal. Almost all of their veg options are fantastic.The downside of QS is their Sunday brunch. I know I know most brunches are breakfast foods only and this place is no exception. On a personal level I don't really care for breakfast food for lunch and since you have no other choices it's not my thing. Like I said though this place is fantastic for veg food so give it a try.I've been introduced to their kale offerings and must admit I'm a huge fan.
