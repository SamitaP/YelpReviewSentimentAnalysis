The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. Food was eh not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didn't text them back. This place has the potential to be great but sadly it falls way too short in almost all areas.The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews.
