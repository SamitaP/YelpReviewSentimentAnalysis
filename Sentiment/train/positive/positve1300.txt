This is a good co-op for Pittsburgh stocking up on local items and friendly staff. However I was surprised at the teeny tiny amount of fresh food. My normal experience with co-ops includes massive amounts of produce dairy baked goods and meats. Not here though; instead it's like a co-op in miniature. Even the mozzarella I was looking for came only in tiny olive-sized balls. Don't get me wrong - I fully support the existence of a co-op especially in an area like the East End but to be honest I think a trip to the Strip District would be much more productive shopping-wise.This is a good co-op for Pittsburgh stocking up on local items and friendly staff.
