I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry but I don't wholly agree with well everyone else; so here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.  I'm aware like many reviewers on this site that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. Yes the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.  But the place itself was a turn off despite the interesting people that it attracts.  Glossy refinished exposed wood beams fake grape vines over the windows and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.  I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive.I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry but I don't wholly agree with well everyone else; so here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.
