The food at the Quiet Storm is usually excellent and unique. It has lots of options for vegetarians and vegans and their specialty drinks (coffee tea milkshakes etc.) are very tasty! However the service is so poor. I have been there probably about 6 times and each time there is an issue. The waitstaff usually seems confused and doesn't appear to care about the customer very much. There has never been a time where I've eaten there and had my order come out correctly. It's either wrong or something was forgotten. There's also usually not an apology. Today our waiter forgot numerous things (why don't they just write the order down?) and even gave us the bill for another table! As much as I enjoy their food I will say that I'm getting tired of the service being so inadequate.The food at the Quiet Storm is usually excellent and unique.
