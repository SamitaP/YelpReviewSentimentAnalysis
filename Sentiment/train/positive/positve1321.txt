I'm so glad we have the Food Co-Op in Pittsburgh. Although still fairly expensive it's less than Whole Foods and I don't do all my shopping here just the things I have a hard time finding elsewhere. The bulk selection is one of the best I've ever seen and I truly appreciate the salad bar on busy days. Their choices are more on the crunchy/hippie side than the high-end gourmet side of things and it's nice to shop for vegetables without having to turn something down because it's not organic...most of the produce is. The staff is helpful and friendly and if someone doesn't know an answer to a question which can happen with a volunteer he or she will find out for you. On member 10% discount days it can get very busy so go early or late.
