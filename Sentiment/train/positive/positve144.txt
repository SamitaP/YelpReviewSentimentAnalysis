They burned my fish and they burned it bad.  Ordering fish at Eat'n Park is always a gamble.  I just never know how it's going to turn out.  I'm a risk taker so I ordered two pieces of baked lemon sole. Well it went terribly wrong.  My waiter came out and said They burned your fish so I had them put two new pieces in the oven.  I was impressed by his honesty and didn't mind waiting for two new pieces.   I gladly helped myself to my boyfriend's french toast while I waited. Then out of no where another server comes to the table with the burnt fish and sets it down infront of me. With the burnt side down of course.  That just shows the kitchen is not in total coordination.  Like I said getting fish from Eatn' Park is a toss up. In the end I got two nicely baked pieces of sole to replace the burnt ones so I left satisfied.They burned my fish and they burned it bad.  Ordering fish at Eat'n Park is always a gamble.
