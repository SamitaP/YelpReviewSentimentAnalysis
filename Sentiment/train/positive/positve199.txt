The musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd so I can't say they are all bad.  However the minimum for a song request is $5.  I spent $20 on a song for my girlfriend and they NEVER played it!!  They were playing songs for $5 and $10 but my $40 got me no where.  Even if they didn't know the song which I doubt they could have picked one they knew and improvised  my tip save your $$ on the requests.Otherwise it's fun for special events every once in awhile.The musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd so I can't say they are all bad.
