Tried this place to get my charred meat on before a steelers game and was not disappointed.  Boneless Buffalo Wings are my loovveeeeeeeee so I'm pretty easy to please there and I was super happy that they allow you to order them in a small portion (5 wings).  I tried a medium spicy sauce (instead of jumping right to hotter 'n hell) because I was sick with anticipation for the steelers game and it was nice and sweet and not bland.  Predicting a healthy selection of nachos and other cheese drenched options at the steeler game I had a salad.  I expected it to be sad and pathetic as salads at wing joints often are but it was really good!  The lettuce was not all nearly white grossness the other veggies were nice and crisp and the toppings were great!  I loovveeed the shredded chicken that didn't have a bunch of gross grease all over it.Tried this place to get my charred meat on before a steelers game and was not disappointed.
