Not really sure what to add.  So I'll bullet point my experience.- Expensive poorly made drinks- Friendly but slow service- Ok food considering (Had the Philly Steak and Cheese)- Over run with kids before 10 that seem to have zero adult supervision- 15% of the games were out of order (Air Hockey Big Bball Game 1/2 of the skee ball random other arcade machines)- Expensive games- Fun time overall with the wife.Not really sure what to add.
