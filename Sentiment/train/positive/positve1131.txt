This place is cool!  But it is also 'cool'.  Service is so-so but the staff doesn't have an attitude they just aren't into serving.  And I'm not a vegan but the food is so good that a carnivore like me doesn't even care. The menu is also huge.  For those of you looking for an ATM- there's one a half block away if you just exit go left and cross the street to the corer convenience store.I could always find a table and spread out with my books. Comfy young hip worth it.  I wish they had alcohol.Try it!This place is cool!  But it is also 'cool'.  Service is so-so but the staff doesn't have an attitude they just aren't into serving.
