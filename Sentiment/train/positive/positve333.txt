On a glorious day in the month of May  my love and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom.  Ha. Just kidding I realized Darren W. Hadn't reviewed here so I had to start it cheesy.  The rock bottom line: Monday for lunch we had awesome service by Ashley.  We weren't rushed and it was quite.  The burgers were great and half off . The beer was very good.  We will be returning for sure.On a glorious day in the month of May  my love and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom.  Ha. Just kidding I realized Darren W.
