I can't believe it's taken me so long to try Quiet Storm.  Weekend brunch was great vegan comfort food. We had VTL (messy delicious red potato smash with seisage scrambled tofu and queso) Country Burrito and sweet Nyam (corn and coconut spiced pudding cake with banana and sweet potatoes). We started with the vegan nachos which were super tasty. Friendly staff and kid friendly even on a busy Saturday afternoon.I can't believe it's taken me so long to try Quiet Storm.
