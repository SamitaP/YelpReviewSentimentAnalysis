My fiance and I like to go to Casbah for special occasions and each time it never disappoints.  The food is great (I highly recommend the Pork Chop and the Short Rib Ravioli) the drinks are wonderful (I am a sucker for good Sangria - and Casbah's is wonderufl) and the service is outstanding (our servers are always friendly prompt and very knowledgeable).My fiance and I like to go to Casbah for special occasions and each time it never disappoints.
