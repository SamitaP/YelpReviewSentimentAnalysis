I struggle with this review. I wish I could give it a 4 but I really can't hate on it like everyone else. Their wait staff has always been super attentive and friendly and their happy hours are great! But a lot of their entrees are a little meh for me especially for the price. Stick to happy hour for wine/cheese platters and enjoy a nice summer evening here.I struggle with this review. I wish I could give it a 4 but I really can't hate on it like everyone else.
