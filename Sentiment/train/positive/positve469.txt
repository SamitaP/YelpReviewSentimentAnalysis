Came out here with my parents to have dinner.  I have to say that our meal was all around worth a 4 star rating but the lousy attitude of the hostess and the man behind the desk who seemed to be in charge quickly lowered that rating.  Our food was pretty good.  The lettuce wraps are usually my favorite part and this time it was no different.  My mom's fried fish peices and veggies was also delicious.  However my $19 Mahi Mahi was pretty much like eating air... there was seriously no taste at all and it was tiny!  I found myself adding all the extra sauces on the table just to try to give it some dang flavoring.If I was you I would order lettuce wraps for an app and lettuce wraps for your meal.  If you have room lettuce wraps for dessert too.  Oh yeah and to drink lettuce wraps.Came out here with my parents to have dinner.
