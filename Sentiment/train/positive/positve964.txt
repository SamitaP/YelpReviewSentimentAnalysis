Went here on father's day with my best friend and it was oddly not crowded at 11:30am on a Sunday. Anyway we got the Brunch prix fixed meal with mimosas! Yum. We sat outside and it was just a nice cool environment with the overhang of plants and vines. For my 2 courses I got the cinnamon polenta which is basically like oatmeal but much more creamier. IT was honestly amazing. I loved it. It came with some almonds and some cranberries but the polenta itself was great. I would come back just to have that for breakfast. For the main dish i got a crab omelette. It came with fresh fruit and potato fingerlings. The potatoes were great and the omelette was ok. Not the best I have had but any place with crab in an omelette should get credit.It was a great brunch and i was stuffed by the end. This place was courteous and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing. We had a great time here and it's just a nice place to relax.Went here on father's day with my best friend and it was oddly not crowded at 11:30am on a Sunday.
