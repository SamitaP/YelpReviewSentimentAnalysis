Best Babaganoush we've had since we visited Egypt.The gaspacho soup was fantastic and since my husband wouldn't share his short rib ravioli I can only assume they were suburb also. The atmosphere was a tad basic but it was also different and therefore interesting and enjoyable.Best Babaganoush we've had since we visited Egypt.The gaspacho soup was fantastic and since my husband wouldn't share his short rib ravioli I can only assume they were suburb also.
