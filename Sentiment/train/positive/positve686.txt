God this is the best eggplant that I have ever tasted!  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the Sicilian eggplant served at Pino's.  My husband couldn't wait to have the seafood fra diavlo which he had last time...again a 10 out of 10!  I had the roasted veggie platter for my entree which is really an appetizer--and I had to share--way too much for one person to eat.  Another comment from our friend (who was a first timer at Pino's) was that it was the best Italian dressing that he ever had.  As I write I want to go back for dinner tonight!!Forgot to mention they also have local beers on tap (East End Brewery) the men enjoyed the Homewood brew (dark lager type beer) it's great to see the owners supporting local businesses!God this is the best eggplant that I have ever tasted!  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the Sicilian eggplant served at Pino's.
