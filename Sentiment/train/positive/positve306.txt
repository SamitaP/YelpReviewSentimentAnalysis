I very much enjoyed my first visit here. I got the Turkey Meatloaf and it was really tasty. It's more sausage than turkey. The cheesy mashed potatoes were excellent. The star of the night was the appetizer the artichoke and crab dip. It was awesome. My only complaint was I ordered a Red Ale and they were out. I had the Curmudgeon instead and it was very good but still.I very much enjoyed my first visit here. I got the Turkey Meatloaf and it was really tasty. It's more sausage than turkey.
