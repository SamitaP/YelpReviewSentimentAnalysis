The environment is just what you would hope for in a coffee shop: tastefully decorated with some local art in an old building with a cool ceiling and floor. A great place to enjoy a beverage book and music.I had an Italian Cappuccino. It was well balanced and I enjoyed every sip. On my way out I had a Costa Rican pour over that took me by surprise. It was incredibly smooth with a complex flavor. It rolled off my tongue without the thin taste of a poorly roasted bean. As the drink cooled the flavor profile changed but continued to please.I highly recommend this shop if you are looking for a place to spend a few hours and enjoy everything from speaking with competent baristas to the last sip of your drink. I will be returning.The environment is just what you would hope for in a coffee shop: tastefully decorated with some local art in an old building with a cool ceiling and floor.
