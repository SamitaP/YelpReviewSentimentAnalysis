The food here is amazing. I have to admit the price is a bit high but it's just worth it. Beware though during dinner times everyone there dresses up pretty formally. I am not talking about suits and ties but you know what I mean so make sure you dress up appropriately!The food here is amazing. I have to admit the price is a bit high but it's just worth it.
