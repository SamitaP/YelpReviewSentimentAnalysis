Casbah was such a great experience. I dined here with my boyfriend and 2 friends for my birthday. Drinks are fairly priced. They offer wine flights and champagne flights. The food was wonderful! I started with a homemade chicken noodle soup. Didn't expect to see it on the menu here but it was really good. My party got the tuna tartare and 2 different olive dishes. Seeing the prices on the menu (all $22+ for entrees) I would have expected a $5 plate of olives to be about 5-6 olives. But it was a bowl full. And they were yummy. For entrees we had the duck breast which according to my boyfriend is the best and most perfectly cooked duck he's ever had. I had a prosciutto plate it was technically an app but it's my birthday and I'll eat what I want! Another member had the cioppino and she loved it. We then got their birthday dessert which was a chocolate cake with ganache and brûlée ice cream. It was great. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner!Casbah was such a great experience.
