We dined here for my wife's birthday last year. We started out at the bar ordering cocktails. I had a tasty cocktail with bourbon. We finished our drinks and made out way over to our table. We started out with a cheese tasting which was very good. For entrees she ordered the Halibut and I had the Red Pepper Casereccia. This was seared sea scollops with a red pepper pasta. This entree made my list of favorite dish ever eaten. It was so delicious. I cannot wait to have it again!We dined here for my wife's birthday last year. We started out at the bar ordering cocktails.
