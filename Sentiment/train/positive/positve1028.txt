My first dining experience at Casbah was a nice one.  We ordered the cheese plate to start and I and I had chicken for my entree.  The wine list was not huge but the selection was nice.  The service was very good.  I plan on returning there in the future for a meal.My first dining experience at Casbah was a nice one.
