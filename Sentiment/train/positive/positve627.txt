I have been eating at Luigi's since before birth (my mom loves this stuff). The new location is nice but I miss the coziness of the old place. The food has been consistent through the transition which happened a long while ago by the way. Also I have read a few other reviews that said Luigi's has left but I talk with him every time I am in. Regardless this is a great family owned pizzeria and I recommend the calzone because it is generously stuffed with ricotta :).I have been eating at Luigi's since before birth (my mom loves this stuff).
