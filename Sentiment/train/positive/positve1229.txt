Me and my kids got food togo from here because it came recommended from someone at the local food co-op as a place with good vegan options.Cute and attractive DIY style decor.Friendly staff.I really liked the food quite a lot (i'de give it 4/5 stars).  GOt a tofu banh mi with a side salad.  When I asked what dressing they had I expected to hear the list of usual uninspiring dressings that vev/non-veg restaurants often have.  The first one she mentioned was a green chili dressing tasted as fun and yummy as it sounded.My kids didn't really love their vegan homefries meal (with scrambled tofu and a weird vegan cheese sauce thang).Anyhoo.  Really pleasantly surprised with this joint and the food was pretty reasonably priced.  As with any place I review I am subtracting a star because they aren't all veg.  Anyplace selling eggs dairy and flesh isn't perfect for me.  I'de probably really call this 3.5 stars.Me and my kids got food togo from here because it came recommended from someone at the local food co-op as a place with good vegan options.Cute and attractive DIY style decor.Friendly staff.I really liked the food quite a lot (i'de give it 4/5 stars).
