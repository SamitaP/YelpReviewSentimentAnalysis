I got pizza here on a Saturday night in a pinch.  Looking for a place that sells by the slice I drove around for a while.  Not only did they have by-the-slice pizza but they also had some of my favorite toppings.  I also hate crust that's too thick and -- although I prefer it even thinner than it was -- I was pretty satisfied with the crust.  The only thing that could be improved is the salad.  We got a grilled chicken salad.  The chicken and fries were okay but the rest was pretty run of the mill.As for the pizza I'll definitely be back for more.I got pizza here on a Saturday night in a pinch.
