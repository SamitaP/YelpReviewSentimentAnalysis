Lots of great vegan local organic gluten-free and/or raw food though some items are quite pricey. Very good rotating-item hot bar for take-out lunch or dinner. Great bulk food selection including diverse reusable glassware of known tare weight. Fresh fruits and vegetables are right-priced but processed items like meats cheeses and frozen items can be surprisingly expensive. Fairly comprehensive selection akin to a Whole Foods.
