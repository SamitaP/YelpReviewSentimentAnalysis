This place has steadily improved over the years and never fails to make me happy.  It's stocked with every variety of weird hippie food.  It's also stocked with the best produce anywhere in the city in the winter months when Giant Eagle's selection looks beat up.  The prepared foods case in the back is deliciously weird.  And it's locally owned/operated so you're not exactly sending your hard earned money to Whole Food's CEO.The membership is lifetime apparently which the employees always kind of failed to express; I thought you had to pay for it yearly and the difference is pretty big.   That said I live far enough away that getting here regularly still doesn't justify the membership.
