As far as chain restaurants go Bar Louie is ok. I really like their appetizers and their salads but I don't care for their burgers or pastas. Their drinks are ok. They're normal corporate restaurant drinks...i.e. Applebees.Service is hit or miss. Last time I went I had just fine service. The time before that was also just fine. Sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesn't know wtf he's talking about. (Once I went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel. I had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is in fact pink. I still don't think he believed me. It would've been amusing if it weren't for the fact that it was actually annoying). Things I like: calamari pretzel sticks wedge salad some of the sandwiches. Things I dislike: frozen burgers they sell for $1.Great to stop in right before a movie at Loews though! :-)As far as chain restaurants go Bar Louie is ok.
