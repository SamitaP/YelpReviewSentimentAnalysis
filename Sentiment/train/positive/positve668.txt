A decent Italian restaurant serving delicious fresh made bread with hummus flat breads salads soups and pasta. Outdoor seating is available in nice weather and the service is friendly. Overall not a bad place but not super exciting either - Pino's suffers from its close proximity to the excellent  Point Brugge Cafe. It also gets quite noisy inside so it's hard to carry on a conversation and seems to attract a somewhat older crowd of people.A decent Italian restaurant serving delicious fresh made bread with hummus flat breads salads soups and pasta.
