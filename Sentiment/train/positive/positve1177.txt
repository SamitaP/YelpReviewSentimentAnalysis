For me this was an especially warm experience. I arrived in Pittsburgh and came straight from the airport. The coffee was perfect the company was even better. I ordered the home-fries with tofu and cheese. They were extraordinary. The tunes being dj'd by the barista didn't hurt either. I definitely dig this place!For me this was an especially warm experience. I arrived in Pittsburgh and came straight from the airport. The coffee was perfect the company was even better.
