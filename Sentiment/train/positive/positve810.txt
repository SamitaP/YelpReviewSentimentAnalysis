Great authentic coffee at a reasonable price. The pastries are really tasty as well but pricier. It is a great atmosphere to catch up with a friend or just relax with a cup of coffee. The staff is also very friendly!Great authentic coffee at a reasonable price. The pastries are really tasty as well but pricier.
