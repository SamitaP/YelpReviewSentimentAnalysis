I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. I've only gone to Duke's one time but the food was good. It wasn't too busy so our service was very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food at all.The place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. The dining room area definitely fills up with an older have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd while the younger crowd is in the bar area. I'll definitely be back since I live in the area.I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. I've only gone to Duke's one time but the food was good.
