First time I was here I had chicken quesadilla's and they were bad.  We went again last weekend. I had the chicken avacod sandwich.  It was very good.  No fat in the chicken.  Just a mess to eat but still awesome.   Also had the chocolate stout cupcake it was amazing.First time I was here I had chicken quesadilla's and they were bad.  We went again last weekend.
