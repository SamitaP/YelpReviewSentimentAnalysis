Great food and very nice decor one of my favorite restaurants outside downtown Pitt.  The best places around Pitt are the bars or bar/restaurants (some of the best in the country IMO).  But if you're looking for a straight-up classy place to eat it's a tough place to beat.Great food and very nice decor one of my favorite restaurants outside downtown Pitt.
