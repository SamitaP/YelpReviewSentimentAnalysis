Six of us went to dinner six of us had fabulous meals!  My husband said his seafood fra diavlo was the best he ever ate not a bit fishy--loaded with fresh seafood and a spicy sauce.  My son had the carbonara which he described as fabulous.  My daughter had the roasted veggie platter as her meal (it is a large appetizer) and I also sampled it--the vegetables and olives were marinated and grilled perfectly.  My father had the skirt steak which he loved and my son had a sausage pizza.  Both said they were delish!  I usually get the eggplant parmesan with their spicy arribiata sauce but this time I had a pasta dish loaded with artichokes and shrimp in a spicy sauce.  It was excellent!  It was my father's birthday and they brought out a Tiramisu for us to share (we didn't even ask for it) and that was luscious as well!  The staff was as nice as can be--we will be back without a doubt!I love this place!Six of us went to dinner six of us had fabulous meals!
