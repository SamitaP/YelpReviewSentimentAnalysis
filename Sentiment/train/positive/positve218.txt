One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite I wish I could purchase it. I am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. Food portion is great. The only complaint I would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side as usual in most local bars. Friendly service will continue to frequent with my family.One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite I wish I could purchase it.
