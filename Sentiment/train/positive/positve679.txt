Enjoyed a wonderful evening eating outdoors on a perfect Pittsburgh spring night.  The charcuterie plate worked well as an appetizer for 3 and included a fantastic balsamic dressing.  I had the best pasta and white clam sauce I've ever experienced and the other members of our party enjoyed their entrees as well.  Nice find in the Point Breeze neighborhood.Enjoyed a wonderful evening eating outdoors on a perfect Pittsburgh spring night.
