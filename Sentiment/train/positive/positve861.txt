The buffalo chicken dip is very good. Their wing nights are decent (gold rush/death row are probably the two best flavors in my opinion). Wednesday night trivia is also fun (thought it took much longer than expected). A good sports bar to say the least usually went there for world cup and euro cup soccer games as well.The buffalo chicken dip is very good.
