Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.Good service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic) however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.While the coffee is great the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously this meat is a fork cutting affair.  However the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.As with Eleven you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.
