This is some of the best coffee I've ever had. I've been looking for a local coffee shop that made good coffee and didn't have irritating quirks in their service (I've run into a cash-only lame hours shop and a we-don't-have-an-espresso-machine shop which are useless to me.)The pastry I had was good though a bit overpriced at ~$3. The mocha I had was absolutely amazing though their largest size is only 16 oz which is an adjustment if you're expecting the larger sizes some other coffee shops produce.This is some of the best coffee I've ever had.
