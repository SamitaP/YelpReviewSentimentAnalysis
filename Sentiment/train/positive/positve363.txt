Although I wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here this is a resturant that I enjoy having a meal at when I am in the Homestead water front. On all of my visits here I have enjoyed the tempura shrimp. The dipping sauce are to die for.  I've found myself craveing the tempura shrimp and the accompanying sauces. The first time I ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister. So this resturant has sentimental value to me. I attach eating here to having a special night out in the Waterfront. Bar Louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food that is.Although I wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here this is a resturant that I enjoy having a meal at when I am in the Homestead water front.
