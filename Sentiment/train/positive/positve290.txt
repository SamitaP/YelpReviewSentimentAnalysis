So I have not been to one of these in awhile since I normally have an aversion to chain restaurants but since I was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place I went along. First surprise: decent beer.  I remembered the normal RB Brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles including a very good imperial IPA that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  Second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than I expected.  Recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great. Service was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. I'll be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh for work.So I have not been to one of these in awhile since I normally have an aversion to chain restaurants but since I was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place I went along.
