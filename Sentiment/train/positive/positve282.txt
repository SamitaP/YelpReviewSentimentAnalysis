Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  We ordered a few appetizers first.  The wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.  Had a burger you can create your own from veggie turkey or fresh ground beef. Had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.The brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasn't busier.Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.
