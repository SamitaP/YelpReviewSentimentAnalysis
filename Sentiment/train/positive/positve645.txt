This is my favorite 'event' restaurant (by which I mean spendy but definitely worth it for special occasions).  It is great for intimate birthdays celebrations etc.  Whatever karmic intervention gave the 'Bustling Borough of Bellevue' this restaurant makes me think we as a community has done something right. But more importantly the food...  Oh the food!  The owner/chef takes so much care it makes the whole experience very enjoyable.  I have never had a bad meal.
