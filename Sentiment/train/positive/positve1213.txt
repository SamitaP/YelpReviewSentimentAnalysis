My boyfriend and I come here every other Saturday at a minimum. He gets the QHF with eggs I get the QHF tofu side of onion gravy. It's potatoes eggs or tofu cheese seisage PICKLED ONIONS (the best) and this yummy aioli (let's be honest it's mayo). I wouldn't call it healthy (maybe I'll consider adding some vegetables to switch it up) but it's the perfect hangover food or post-long run indulgence. They do have many healthier options as well we're just hooked on the QHF and can't stop. I have also loved the country burrito grits and hangover hash. They only have the QHF on Saturdays (and other days) and have a different pre-fix drink included brunch menu on Sundays. The coffee is delicious also. Sometimes I wish the staff were a bit friendlier but they're all pretty busy running around. The absolute best part is that they're always crowded but there's almost never a wait when we go which makes for the perfect brunch spot!My boyfriend and I come here every other Saturday at a minimum.
