Ok this is my first yelp review I never left any reviews for other restaurants but I am writing it because I want others to know about this place more.Restaurant run by family. very friendly clean cooking environment and Great food. I would come to this place again and again whenever I visit Pittsburgh.Its less than 10min drive from Kennywood if you are visiting Kennywood you should definitely try this place.Ok this is my first yelp review I never left any reviews for other restaurants but I am writing it because I want others to know about this place more.Restaurant run by family. very friendly clean cooking environment and Great food.
