Don't even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard cinnamon butter and a spicy queso dip. The queso is my favorite but they were all delish. I also got the bruschetta which was very garlicky but delicious. 5-7 M-F is 1/2 off appetizers so I was able to get both the pretzel sticks and bruschetta for 7 bucks as a meal. The menu had a pretty wide range- my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad. We didn't get drinks but some looked good...Don't even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard cinnamon butter and a spicy queso dip.
