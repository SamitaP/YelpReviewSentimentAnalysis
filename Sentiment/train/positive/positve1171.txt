The Quiet Storm is a classic being one of the largest selections of vegetarian and vegan entrees in the city. Recently came with about 13 people for a Saturday lunch. I won't speak for everyone's dish but I got the curry which was very tasty if not a bit skimpy on the rice and a little thin for my liking. My friend got the QHF which is a tofu scramble mixed with home fries and seisage which was absolutely delicious. She also got a side of spicy aioli which went extremely well with the breakfast dish. The service was prompt and they just left pitchers of water on the table for us which was great. Always a great choice for meat-eaters and veggie's alike. If you go with a large group though beware because it is difficult to work in the added gratuity and tax with the cash-only. The waiter wouldn't let us split it up and take individually so it was difficult on that end.The Quiet Storm is a classic being one of the largest selections of vegetarian and vegan entrees in the city.
