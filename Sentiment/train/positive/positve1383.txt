Visited this wonderful eclectic Portuguese restaurant and had the pleasure of meeting the owner(s) and head chef.  Tihs has been our 4th opportunity to visit this restaurant and we have never been disappointed.  The opportunities for dining are quite expansive and quite salacious.  Its BYOB policy also allows one to experience the wines of your own choice to pair with the most exquisite menus.  We had the Goat Cheese Puff Pastry and Mussels as appetizers and the Red Snapper w/Apricot sauce and a whole Bronzino - quite Yummy!!Their specials are all so inviting and we of course look forward to our next visit to PItt and a guaranteed visit to Cafe Zhino.   We of course also look forward to trying out the rest ( and I am sure the specials will grow ) of the menu.  Cheers !
