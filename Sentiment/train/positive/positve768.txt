The coffee is really awesome but the brunch wasn't anything spectacular.  It was also exceptionally busy and me and my three friends had to crowd around a teeny tiny table.  All of us felt like the panini/burritos were totally edible and good just not great.  The flavors just weren't super tasty.  I would say yay on coming here for coffee sort of yay on coming for food.It kind of bothers me that it shows up as the number one restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I mean it DEFINITELY does not deserve that ranking.  I wouldn't want out-of-towners coming to Pittsburgh and thinking that's the best we have.The coffee is really awesome but the brunch wasn't anything spectacular.
