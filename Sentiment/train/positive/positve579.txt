A OK!Really loved the bacon wrapped shrimp! So amazing with the sauce on the side. This was probably the the best part of the meal.  I also had blacken salmon with a double order of spinach instead of a starch. The spinach was just steamed without any flavoring... Which is better in the long run  but I wish they had options for sauteed with garlic. The service was great as well!  We were always taken care of.  Will definitely bring my bf here in the future.A OK!Really loved the bacon wrapped shrimp! So amazing with the sauce on the side. This was probably the the best part of the meal.
