Great atmosphere and rather humble especially for a chain restaurant. The service is always friendly even if they are busy. I enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. I highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp. Be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too!Great atmosphere and rather humble especially for a chain restaurant. The service is always friendly even if they are busy.
