We visitied PF Changs on Sunday with a large group of 20 people.  Although they had to split the tables - everything was delicious!We enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!if you are with a group and you want dessert - get the fried bananas!  They come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconut/pineapple ice cream.Overall we had a great time and would come back here again.We visitied PF Changs on Sunday with a large group of 20 people.
