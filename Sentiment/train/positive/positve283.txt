Here's the trick to enjoying a meal at Rock Bottom: don't get fancy with your food order.  Stick with the sandwiches salads burgers and bar food; and you'll be OK.  I've had bad experience will all the fish dishes (including the fish and chips).  Also I've found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area.  Join the Mug Club even if you don't go often and rack up points for free mugs and beers.  Thursdays are Trivia Nights and the DJ is playing the music loud so go if you don't really want to have a conversation with the person you're with :)Here's the trick to enjoying a meal at Rock Bottom: don't get fancy with your food order.
