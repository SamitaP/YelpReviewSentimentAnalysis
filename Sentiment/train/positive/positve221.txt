This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.Walking into such a huge space especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.Un-nerving actually. Because Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.As far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.But most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.And while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.Especially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. And proceeded to dominate.Trust.This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.Walking into such a huge space especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.Un-nerving actually.
