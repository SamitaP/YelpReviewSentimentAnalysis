China Garden appears to be your run of the mill Chinese take out place (standard menu decor etc)  but I was very pleasantly surprised how good the food was.  We had both the cashew chicken and seafood delight and both were awesome.  Also worth noting they are super fast (food was ready within 10 minutes).  I'd easily say this is the best Chinese takeout place I've found since I've been in Pittsburgh (about a year).  Highly recommend it.China Garden appears to be your run of the mill Chinese take out place (standard menu decor etc)  but I was very pleasantly surprised how good the food was.
