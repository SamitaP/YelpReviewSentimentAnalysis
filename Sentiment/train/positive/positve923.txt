You can see their second bar through the front windows.  I always assumed that that was their first bar and just walked by the place maybe a hundred times until walking in and noticing that everyone was drinking in a different bar.In other words this place is *huge* inside.  The place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas; I like the decor even if it might be slightly dated.  Chinese and Korean food at or above my expectations.  The stuff on the menu is good and they're willing to put together things that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely.  Kung pao tofu is my favorite so far.You can see their second bar through the front windows.
