What a wonderful hidden gem!My boyfriend and I have been here twice and we have raved about it both times.  The service is wonderful - the employees are patient kind and helpful.  The food isn't 5 star but it IS really really good and best of all cheap as hell!Sure the pizza may not be cut into pizza shape but that doesn't make it any less wonderful at all.  Everything I have ever had here is wonderful and I will definitely be taking multiple 30 minute trips back here to support this independent business.What a wonderful hidden gem!My boyfriend and I have been here twice and we have raved about it both times.
