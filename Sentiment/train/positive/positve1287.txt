5 stars for a pizza joint? Unheard of from me until now! The shady side special is the only pizza we have ever ordered from here and I'm pretty sure it's the only thing we ever will order because it is just that fantastic! I mean I hate canned black olives and this thing is loaded with them but they aren't overpowering. The combination of all the flavors makes my mouth sing its so happy. Sadly we live over an hour away so it's a very rare time that we travel to shady side and don't have a sit down meal as opposed to take away pizza.The service here is always very friendly and quick. My husband used to save up to order a shady side special when he was in school. Seriously any meal that he saves up for better be amazing and this is!5 stars for a pizza joint?
