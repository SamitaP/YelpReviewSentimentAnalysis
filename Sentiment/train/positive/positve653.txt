I've been going here since I was a wee tot.  I have always enjoyed their food even though there's nothing too special about it.  I really like their breakfast menu.  You always seem to get lots of food for very little money which is nice.  My only complaint is that it is WAY TOO SMALL and always very busy.  They should really look at expanding the restaurant.I've been going here since I was a wee tot.  I have always enjoyed their food even though there's nothing too special about it.
