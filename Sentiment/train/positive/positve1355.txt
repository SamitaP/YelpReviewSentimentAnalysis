Interesting menu with a lot of things we'd like to go back and try. We started with the Zinho salad that I highly recommend.For entrees I had a grouper filet with a cucumber mint sauce and a cous cous. It was a subtle dish but very fresh and tasty. My girlfriend had a chicken dish in a great red pepper sauce. The entrees come with these nicely grilled vegetables -- everything tastes really fresh.The Tres Leche cake is incredible!Great artsy atmosphere with friendly staff. Like previous reviewers have said it's eclectic but not over the top and it has a warm and personal vibe. The owners gave us wine. :)
