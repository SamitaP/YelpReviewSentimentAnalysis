This place is a keeper! It was pretty good. I got the Cajun chicken sandwich with french fries for take out. I waited at the bar and ordered a drink while I waited. I had the Caipirinha... Not as good as Seviche's but then again this is Buffalo Blues.... If you need an All American food fix this is the place to be.This place is a keeper! It was pretty good.
