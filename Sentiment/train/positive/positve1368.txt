Went here for a private party: it was lovely.The owners and staff made this whole experience. It was a private birthday party and BYO. The staff made it fun and easy for use to relax and celebrate and the food was fantastic. We had a bit of a limited menu but EVERYTHING that I ate was great. 5 stars!
