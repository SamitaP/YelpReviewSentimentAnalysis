It gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory. Back before Pizza Hut turned into a fast food restaurant the Pizza Hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant. And this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out. So this is the old style pizza hut. Very family orientated dining style. You can sit here for hours. And so we did. We had a heap of use in a long table.I ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. Disappointed in the selection of that. Seeing other choices... I regretted going on the cheap. Prices are moderate. 12 for a little pizza... but with all the dough you get full. Can't say I walked away hungary. Nor did I finish my second mini pizza. I want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza!It gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory.
