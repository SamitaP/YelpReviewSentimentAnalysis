We stopped by for the first time on a cold Friday night around 9:30. We made sure to have reservations as the place is pretty small. It's BYOB and we didn't bring our own wine because we weren't in a drinking mood but once we sat down we realized this was the kind of place where you needed a bottle of wine. The decor is like an slightly charming mess of old furniture clean table clothes and scarves draped over the windows of the converted garage. We sat right by the door and right under the old dresser that the owners stand at. The food was good. We ordered the tomato garlic bisque which was delicious. The stuffed peppers with crab and goat cheese were tasty but the plate was super hot and the peppers were cold so that was a bit off. For main courses we ordered the salmon and the lobster ravioli. The salmon was great. It w cooked well and had a dill cream sauce on it. It was supposed to be served with risotto but instead came with a dried cake of old creamy looking rice. I ignored that and ate the steamed and grilled veggies they used to garnish the plate. The lobster ravioli was amazing but instead of coming in it's own sauce they simply poured on the tomato garlic bisque that we had already ordered as a first course. After reading mixed reviews about this place I was pleasantly surprised This place was a hot mess with slightly cold food but I really liked it.
