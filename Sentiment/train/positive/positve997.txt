So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss and I got a hit here whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case the crab sandwich was good-- nice large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine however was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!  Save your money buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!).So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch.
