Some of the best coffee in Pittsburgh (and many argue that it is in fact -the- best). Really warm rich blends especially the espresso. The tea menu is extensive and has a lot of variety so it's a great place for non-coffee-drinkers too. It has a relaxed atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating (is there anything cosier than curling up in one of the window seats with a book/notebook on a rainy day?). I've done it all here-- from writing and filing an article when the newsroom was too loud to meeting a blind date. It's a good place to linger and savor. Its proximity to the park is a big advantage.Some of the best coffee in Pittsburgh (and many argue that it is in fact -the- best). Really warm rich blends especially the espresso.
