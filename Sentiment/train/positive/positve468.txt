A big thank you to Chad Cynamom manager at PF Chang's for making our anniversary night so special.  He seated us brought us drinks and told us about the menu.  Every time my fiance and I go to this PF Chang's we get the best service.  Food isn't the most authentic chinese food we've ever had hence the 4 stars.  It is a bit overpriced as well but the service makes up for it.A big thank you to Chad Cynamom manager at PF Chang's for making our anniversary night so special.
