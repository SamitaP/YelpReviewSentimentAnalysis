I make a point to visit this restaurant every time I'm in town. I'm a mostly-vegan vegetarian who has been living in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 17 years so my expectations for veggie food are rather high. Quiet Storm cuisine does not disappoint. Creative and fun menu items and plentiful vegan options.I make a point to visit this restaurant every time I'm in town.
