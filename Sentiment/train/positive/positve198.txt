Always a good time although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. Shut out to the piano players who can not only play the piano but also sing play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening it's difficult to get seats. Believe me I don't mind standing but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.Always a good time although it's definitely not a place I would visit often.
