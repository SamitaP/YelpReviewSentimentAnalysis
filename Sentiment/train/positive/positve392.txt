My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night. You can gat a burger (beef chicken portabella or turkey) in a bun with lettuce for a buck. Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents veggies 50 cents Artery Cloggers 75 cents sauce 25 cents. Those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well. My burger was $2.25 after I added toppings. Is it the best burger I've ever had? No. But is it the best $2.25 burger I've ever had?  Yes. It's kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. Mine was well done and one if my son's burger had pink in the middle. We probably could have sent it back but we don't mind a little pink. I love the tater tots!  They are crispy and have the right amount of salt. Yummy!!Our server was great and we'll definitely be back.My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night.
