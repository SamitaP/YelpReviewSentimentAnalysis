Beautiful decor. Very genuine staff. Very clean washrooms. Delicious food. I tried the market trio. The blackened tilapia was nice with a little bit of spice. This is a great place for a seafood lover.Beautiful decor. Very genuine staff. Very clean washrooms. Delicious food. I tried the market trio.
