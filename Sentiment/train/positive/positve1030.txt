Wonderful brunch and good dinner. The service obviously prides itself on being super proper (choreographed plate delivery polite to the point of almost sappy attitude on the part of the waiters) and it can be a little bit annoying even. However this is the probably the classiest of the Big Burrito restaurants so if you're looking for that this place is great. Extensive yet expensive wine menu. Small-ish portions and a very pleasant covered heated patio.Wonderful brunch and good dinner.
