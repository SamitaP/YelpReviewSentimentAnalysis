I personally enjoyed my recent visit to Bar Louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help. The restaurant is pricey for what it is and our waitress was a bit lackluster.So why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio!Happy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts $4 Wines $5 Martinis and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us and our bill was less than $40 total. Not bad!I ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro Spinach & Artichoke Dip and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good and I would order all three items again in the future.My recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at (Happy Hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times!I personally enjoyed my recent visit to Bar Louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help.
