Just ate there right next to GameStop & Google has 3 small booths & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95). Food is fast fresh & hot but mine had too much onion & not enough steak. At the end of the meal I was just eating onions with rice though I hear this is healthy for you. Counter lady was cordial but didn't reply when customers told her Have a nice day #awkward. I know that English isn't her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well. Wasn't stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate (I usually get this feeling eating Asian). This is basically a nice place to go for lunch that won't ruin your appetite for dinner. (Side note: Food is very clean. Brushed my teeth an hour before w/ Tom's of Maine fluoride-free peppermint & still had minty fresh breath an hour after eating)Just ate there right next to GameStop & Google has 3 small booths & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95).
