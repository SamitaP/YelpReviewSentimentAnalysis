I didn't know what to expect when I walked in but I am now a fan. There is a cool way to review the menu on a touch kiosk to find out the calorie count. The place looked nice. It was clean and really cool looking. The food was really good and our waiter was nice and friendly. I will be going back to try their pizza and other food. We had a burger which was really good and we had the lobster slider. French fries were good to.I didn't know what to expect when I walked in but I am now a fan.
