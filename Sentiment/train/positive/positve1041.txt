Love this place. I've never had anything that wasn't tasty here. They do fish and meat very well. It's not obscure molecular gastronomy style but dishes we have had here were all well prepared and savory. We have been to several business dinners in their space downstairs and it really is my favorite place for these - even more than the pricier steakhouses 'dahntahn.'Wait staff were very attentive and really made our experiences here great. Food was served efficiently for large groups and arrived at the correct temperature. They have a great wine list and overall offer a comfortable space with delicious food and drinks. Try the lamb loin chicken and cioppino - my three current favorites. Their pork chops are the specialty of the house I'm told.Will definitely be back.Love this place.
