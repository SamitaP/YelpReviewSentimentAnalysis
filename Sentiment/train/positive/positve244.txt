DAVE & BUSTERS!  It's a nice place to eat have fun and drink!!  All ages can enjoy this place.  I was so EXCITED to hear them announce that after 10p all children whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go!  It made for a nice evening for adults only.  Everytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves.  I didn't give it FOUR STARS because every time I've went I haven't been able to eat in the restaurant area of there.  I know I still get the same food that everyone else does wherever you sit.  Sometimes I like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant.  I haven't as of yet been seated there.  Not to mention that the servers around the bar are a little slow at responding to customers as well.  So all in all D&B's is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment.  Just don't expect to be seated in the restaurant portion and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area.DAVE & BUSTERS!  It's a nice place to eat have fun and drink!!
