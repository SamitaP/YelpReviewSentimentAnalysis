This place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. It offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. Still ha that neighborhood feel though. I have never had food there though they offer paninis. Great desserts. Good espressos and okay coffee.Outdoor seating. Good place to study. Plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless.This place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk.
