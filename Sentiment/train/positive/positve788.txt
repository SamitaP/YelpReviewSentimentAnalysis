I tell everyone about this Highland Park gem my friend introduced me to. People who come here appreciate expertly steamed milk and delicious breakfast/lunch options. In this quaint shop gone are the days of the mass-produced lattes and microwaved sandwiches. Every time I visit Pittsburgh I make sure this place is in my schedule somewhere. Love it.I tell everyone about this Highland Park gem my friend introduced me to. People who come here appreciate expertly steamed milk and delicious breakfast/lunch options.
