I'm giving 4 stars mostly because of the beer....large selection & decent prices.   The food is pretty good but nothing to rave about.  The menu has a good variety and everything I've tried has been good.  Portions are large.  One side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere....with several TV's & 2 pool tables.  It's very wide open with extremely high ceilings.  The other side is more for families or people who aren't concerned about watching sports.  In general it has a relaxed atmosphere.  I've always had quick & friendly service.  I love the whole Waterfront area....so much to do!I'm giving 4 stars mostly because of the beer....large selection & decent prices.
