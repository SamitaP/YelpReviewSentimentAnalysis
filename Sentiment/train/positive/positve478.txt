I've heard it's very much a chain and that it's not at all authentic Chinese food however despite all that I have to admit the food was good and the service was excellent.  There is quite a disconnect with the loud Rock music played in the dining room and the serene Chinese decor but I figure it works for somebody!  I ordered the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli and the meal was quite tasty.  The prices are quite reasonable.  Just as long as you are not looking for authentic Chinese dishes this restaurant will definitely serve in a pinch.I've heard it's very much a chain and that it's not at all authentic Chinese food however despite all that I have to admit the food was good and the service was excellent.
