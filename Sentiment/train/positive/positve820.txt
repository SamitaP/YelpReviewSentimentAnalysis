I've heard a bunch of good things about this place so I decided to make a trip over there on a Sunday to check it out. While I enjoyed the coffee and cookies I bought I have to say that everything seems to be a bit overpriced and I did get a feeling of snobbery from some of the staff. However the venue was actually nice with a nice neighborhood feel. Every time I have been there since it has been really crowded and I've had trouble finding a seat. I would love to go back in the summer and sit outside at one of the tables.I've heard a bunch of good things about this place so I decided to make a trip over there on a Sunday to check it out.
