Spices spices spices! Best deal in town when you run out of something and don't want to pay $7 for another bottle of parsley at Giant Eagle. I also appreciate the affordable selection of local milk products eggs bread (Allegro Hearth yum!)  and honey. One gripe - salad mix it's 4.99 a bag! You can get the same salad mix at TJ's for 1.99 2.99 if you want organic. And currently most of the produce is shipped from other states/countries. I don't know if that will change as summer rolls but more local would be great.
