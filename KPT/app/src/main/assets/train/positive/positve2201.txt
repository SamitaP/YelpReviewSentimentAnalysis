My go-to Indian buffet in the South hills for simple non-pretentious Indian buffet food.  My prior fave was Billu's which recently CLOSED.  : (Namaste is run by a family of Sikh Indian folks who are friendly and accomodating.This is not Indian food at the gourmet level of somewhere like Tamarind or The Mintt but it's good enough for govt. work as the saying goes .
