Best breakfast in Pittsburgh. Every time I come here I'm never failed.  On my most recent adventure I took my Mom and Step dad who were in for a visit.  There was a special on sausage biscuits with gravy. OH. MY. GOD.   It was so delicious it was ALMOST was good as my grandma's.  I savored every bite and my only issue was that there wasn't more.  :(As always the restaurant was packed and loud. I love that about the Dor-Stop b/c it's so Pittsburgh.  Did I mention how much I love this place?!?!
