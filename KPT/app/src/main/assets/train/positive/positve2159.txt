They have one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. I have never had anything bad here. Great meat products just don't get the sausage patties. They are not of high quality but everything else is. French Toast is excellent. Pancakes are good but are really sweet like a donut. You have to be in the mood for them. Like I said they are very sweet. Only negative of this place is the restaurant is small and crammed it is always packed and there is always a wait.
