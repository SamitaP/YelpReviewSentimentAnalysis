The Dor-Stop was crowded and we did have to wait for about 10 minutes.  Not to bad on a Sunday morning.  Waitress was quick to get coffee to us.  It did take a little longer than you would expect to get the meal...we all started to get really hungry.  Ordered the Eggs Benedict which were pretty ordinary.  Comes with the ordinary home fries.
