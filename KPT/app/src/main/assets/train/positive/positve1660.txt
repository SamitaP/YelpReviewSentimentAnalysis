Food: menu will appeal to vegetarians and non-vegetarians with daily dinner specials separate lunch (sandwiches) and dinner (entrees) menus both soups were vegetarian (according to the waitress never heard of vegetarian minestrone before) I ordered penne with multiple veggies and a white wine sauce it was above average but not great soup was good a bowl of bread sticks was on the table and replaced regularly salad was average size and qualityPrice: dinners range from $12-18 with most toward the higher end of that range not expensive but the quality of the food probably deserves the lower end of that scaleDrinks: BYOBAtmosphere: sports bar-family restaurant type setting with pictures of athletes all over the wall but better than sports bar quality food and serviceService: waitress refilled water many times was on the ball and timely answered all questions about the menu(+): good service reasonable prices good but not great food(-): nothing wrong with Legends but also nothing spectacularWould I go back again? I wouldn't drive to the North Side to eat here but if I was in the North Side it would be at the top of the list particularly if friends/family were at AGH (directly across the street).
