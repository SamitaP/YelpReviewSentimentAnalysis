This place is fantastic. A robust selection of beers on tap and literally a thousand different beers in bottles - this place is half bar/restaurant half beer warehouse. But the drink selection might not even be the best part as the food here was awesome. I went with the Chicago Dog for a modest four bucks and it was as good as any I'd ever had - perfectly grilled dog all the right high-quality toppings and a fresh-tasting bun. The pub fries sealed the deal though - a huge pile of fries with generous helpings of perfectly-melted cheese and just-soft-enough-just-crispy-enough bacon. My friend and I could have shared the large order of Pub Fries and been just fine. I saw someone's sandwich across the bar and it was truly enormous - I could come here with a friend and for ten bucks get my fill of sandwich fries and beer for the rest of the day. Great value great experience!!
