If you're looking for good Chinese food at relatively inexpensive prices then China Taste is it. Large portions fantastic steamed (and fried) dumplings great combo selections all around a solid take-out place. Only downside is they DO NOT deliver. Other than that it is well worth it whenever you have the hankering for some Asian cuisine and a Netflix type of night.
