Tasty traditional not trendy and tempermental. Greens & beans rock! Dining here is as if your best friend invited you to tag along to Sunday dinner at his chef Uncle Nino's place. BYOB of Chianti to pair with the solid unpretentious food in a modest setting with a nostagic wait-staff. Long before the open kitchen concept became a hot topic this cook's line has turned out many a quality  plate over the years.
