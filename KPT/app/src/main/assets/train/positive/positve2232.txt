Bado's is a definite neighborhood joint.  Located on Beverly in Mt. Lebo it's super-busy during meal times.  Food can be hit and miss.  Best to stick with the pizza which is pretty good and the soup and salads which are quite good.  Place also has a solid beer selection which is reasonably priced.  That said we've found that it's a total mistake to order anything else off the menu -- except at breakfast which again is pretty good.  (Their omlets are huge!)  For example we once ordered a spinach-artichoke app.  Sounded delicious.  Um... it was creamed spinach (probably of frozen origin) with some canned artichokes in it.  Disappointing to say the least.Also be aware that they close the kitchen ... when they feel like it.  I didn't know that until we were drinking a few beers there a while back and they made a kitchen last call.  My sister asked the bartender when the kitchen closes -- he said when we feel like it.One thing is for sure though if you go with what they do best (Pizza and beer) you won't be disapointed.  Plus the servers are true Pittsburgh and generally very sweet.
