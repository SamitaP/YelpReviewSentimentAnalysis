Do you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going getting coffee.It is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.Other reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating).- free wifi- outside tables- tasty treats- they have a blog!- really great coffee- the staff are coffee experts
