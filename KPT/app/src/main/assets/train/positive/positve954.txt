Such a pleasure to dine on my birthday at a restaurant with such good food and cocktails right in Shadyside. We planned in advance to come here after I received Big Burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks. The food--short rib ravioli lamb and polenta pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent perfect for a celebratory meal. Our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. My favorite: the local martini all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives. Almost like a cocktail and small plate in one.After reading everyone else's reviews I hope to come back here next for brunch.**to take Big Burrito up on this offer join their mailing list decently before your birthday and a voucher will come in the mail! It was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students.
