I have eaten here many times in the last 27 years and I must say I have never had a bad meal here.  The Reuben is good as is the Turkey Reuben which is served between 2 potato pancakes instead of bread.  The Beefeater Sandwich is always a good bet.  The beef is always tender and never fatty or grisly.  For the times when I'm a bit more hungry I get the Wienerschnitzel.  Try the German Potato Salad and/or the Sweet and Sour Cabbage.  And don't forget dessert.  The desserts are homemade by the owner's wife.
