Currently we are sitting in a booth enjoying the craft beer selection. We have dined here many times and love it.  It is not your old crowd and not the new drinkers.  The crowd is late 20s and 30s. Perfect for a night out.  There is not a 5 star because the amount of people doesn't fit the nose and the menu is too large for almost midnight. They have full menus until 2am.
