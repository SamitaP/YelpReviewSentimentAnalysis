This is a place you either love or hate   I love it!  every time I am in Pittsburgh I have to stop in and get enough so I have take home.  The pizza is sold by the square slice.  The sauce is chunky tomato based and baked with cheese. period. after it comes out of the oven it is sliced and heaped with more cheese and what ever topping you want.  I suggest just sticking to the peperoni.  The toppings are not cooked the cheese melts a bit but not all the way and the peperoni is lukewarm at best.  My mouth is watering while I write this.  You probably will not see 3 stars on any reviews.  Give it a shot
