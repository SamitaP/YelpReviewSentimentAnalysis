Had lunch here after getting my nails done in the Waterfront.  It's your standard Panera - lots of seating and a sunny room from all the windows.  Our food was made very quickly even though the place was pretty busy (lunch on a Saturday).  Chicken noodle soup is tasty but there was too much broth and not enough noodles and chicken.  I tried their Sierra Chicken sandwich for the first time and it was pretty good.  It's very flavorful I like whatever they put in their chipotle mayo.  It was a salty meal though - definitely had me running to the fountain machine to get more water.If I have to get a quick light meal and only chain options are available Panera is my best choice.  It's definitely predictable and usually tasty.  But there isn't much special about it of course.
