We've been here twice and the first time wasn't so great. We started with baked artichokes which were super tangy and swimming in oil. I had Pasta Siciliano and hubs had Pasta Mafaldo. He ate more of mine than his own. The Mafaldo tasted pretty bland. The pasta Siciliano was better but nothing to write home about and I wouldn't order it again. The bread at Italian restaurants is normally something I look forward to but this was like a regular roll with olive oil and Parmesan cheese on top - ehh. The cannoli was the best part of the meal. Visit two was much better! We started with the homemade hot stuffed peppers which were phenomenal! I had to make myself stop eating to save room for dinner. We ordered spaghetti with meatballs and pollo divino pizza. The peppers were the shining star of the meal! Second would be the pizza because it was interesting and delicious. We ordered with white sauce and it perfectly complimented the chicken and cheddar. The overall spaghetti was okay but the meatballs really made it slightly above ordinary.
