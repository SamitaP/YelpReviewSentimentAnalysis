I've had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly I'm never been disappointed nor elated with the food. It's 'upscale' Ameri-Chinese food. You don't come here seeking 'authentic' Asian staples; it's all changed to some degree to suit American taste buds... nothing wrong with that imo. Do I even know what 'authentic' Chinese food is? Yes sortuv somewhat. Will I stop putting quotes around 'everything'? Definitely not!It was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.This particular PF Changs on the Homestead Waterfront had fast and friendly service though he forgot our order of asparagus. We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles. Good flavors nothing that stepped out in the crowd.I don't come here all that often but when I do I invariably leave feeling satisfied and full.
