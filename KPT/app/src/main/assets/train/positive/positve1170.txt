Nice little coffee house with good food.  My only complaint is that the food was NOT HOT ENOUGH which is a bigggg turn off for me. However it was still so good that I'm giving this place 4 stars.  The apple panini was a delicious hot mess clearly invented by somebody who got the munchies and only had raisin bread apples cheese and seitan around....the result is amazing.  This place just needs to make sure the food is warm!Dip is a huge ripoff btw....$5 for a tiny portion :/  they should lower the price on that item.The salsa that came with my sandwich is some of the best salsa I've ever had though. Dunno if they make it themselves.
