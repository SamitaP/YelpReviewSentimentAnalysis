My local sports bar.  It has the prefered sound and  enough televisions so no matter how busy it is my neck isn't cramped and I don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game.  It is a bar.  It has bar food.  Nothing really stands out for me in the realm of fries sandwhiches and wings.  On the other hand I've never had a bad experience either.  So when I eat there I'm not anticipating dissapointment or spectacular but I am expecting constantcy.  Consistancy is what is delivered.  Buffalo Blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics.  Service is spotty I do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when I go there.  The plus is when specific staff is working the  place is that much of a better establishment.  Consistantly just above average in my opinion.I chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment.  5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues.  I would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich I'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars.
