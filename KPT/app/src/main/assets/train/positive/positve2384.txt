Yum! I think Ive been here three times since moving to PGH Fav dogs: Chihuahua  Brat and Chicago style dog. Never tried other entrees but their fries are nice and crispy. They have plenty of Belgian beers to choose from a bonus in my beer book.Beers: usually a good variety on tap plus tons of variety if you need to one stop shop and pick some six packs up in the back. Warning though if it is a busy summer evening you can wait up to one hour for your dog I think this is because they have tiny kitchen behind the bar. So if you're super hungry go early or later or fill up on their beer first. Also this doesn't really bother me i still ate my food but the guy cooking the food didn't wear gloves and did touch the food with his bare hands often. If you're OCD maybe just get a beer or don't sit at the bar where you can see this. Don't worry he didn't pick anything up off the floor and put it back on plates i checked. :)
