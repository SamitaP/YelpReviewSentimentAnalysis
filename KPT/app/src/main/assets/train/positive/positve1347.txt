I love supporting co-ops and other local grocers but for whatever reason I kept putting off visiting East End Food Co-op. This all changed yesterday when I was desperate for a healthy smoothie and nowhere near one. We were a little confused as to how to get into the co-op because didn't realize that it was on the opposite street all tucked away. After we figured that out by following another patron we were really excited to walk through the doors. If you've never been into a co-op you should know that they are typically smooshed together and have an interesting smell that emanates from the bulk-spices isle. I love this smell. It's really the best grocery store smell EVER.Proceeding through the store we noticed the colorful and abundant produce section. So many beautiful fruits veggies and herbs. The prices varied but they were probably on par with what you would pay for any other organic produce somewhere else. When we found the back area with hot foods cold foods and the smoothies...I died of happiness. There were so many wonderful things back there. The food bar is $7.99 a pound which is a lot cheaper than some places! The smoothies were all very tasty sounding but I settled on a smoothie with soy ice cream strawberries and papaya juice. Oh my god. It was so delicious! My boyfriend got the King smoothie and he really enjoyed his too.Right beside the smoothie bar there is a section for all kinds of books. My eye was caught by an organic and local homebrewing book. It is now on my list of must haves! The rest of the store was great. I especially love the cheese selection (we bought AMAZING and LOCAL tomato-basil havarti) the vegan meat products and the prices. I'll definitely be coming here a lot more. It's a great little co-op and it is definitely the best I have been in!
