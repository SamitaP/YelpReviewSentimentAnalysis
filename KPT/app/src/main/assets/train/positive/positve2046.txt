After watching Diner's Drive In's and Dives this restaurant caught our attention.  After finally making it to Pittsburgh it was the first place we tried! I had the Jumbot (the mix of potatoes eggs ham. peppers onion and cheese etc) It was great and hit the spot perfect with a Pumpkin Pancake! The coffee was hot the service was friendly and quick and very attentive! Great start to our trip to Pittsburgh!
