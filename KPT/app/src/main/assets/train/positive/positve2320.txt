During my visit to Pittsburgh I wanted to experience the best that the city has to offer when it comes to local dives. And this place did not disappoint simply because of their awesome selection of imported beers and microbrews in the cave. Just be prepared to shell out the cash for it. Any place that serves Delirium Tremens on tap deserves high praise! As a Chicago native I've had my fair share of meat encased goodness. And while these signature dogs are very good its hard to crown them the best I've ever had. On the other hand the fries were perfectly crispy and delicious. therefore a must.  The waiting staff was super friendly and its plugged in a great neighborhood. Overall I'd give the place 4 1/2 stars instead of the 4 if I could. What I had:Big Ben hot dog (typical Pittsburgh toppings)Chili cheese fries (the small was enough for two)Cold glass of DT (duh!)When did I go:Saturday @ noon - plenty of space without the waitWill I come back? Even though it was my first time I would definitely come back again and again.
