Went here with a couple friends during a conference across the river. Service was typical for a this style restaurant nothing spectacular.  Half off appetizers for happy hour so I got the sampler (again nothing spectacular). Decent meal. My friend was disappointed by the his chili and the other did not really enjoy his buffalo pirogies. I might go back if I want some cheap appetizers and a beer during happy hour.  Seating outside was ok at best.
