12/15/12 heard about Legends so we thought we would give it a try tonight following our attending the Musical Christmas Carol.  We had reservations which are needed given the size of the place.  Maybe a capacity of 35 or 40.   We got seated right away.  I ordered the beans and greens and the Bird ordered the mussels for appetizers.  Although I tend to like beans and greens with sausage they did not have sausage however they were really tasty.   The mussels were a nice portion and also very good.The Bird ordered the Gnocchi with the meat sauce.  Again it was a nice portion and they were very good!  I ordered the tortellini special which also turned out to include the ravioli.  (A nice surprise ).The dinner salads were also above average in that they included Gorgonzola  Greek olives and cucumber.  I wasn't that crazy about the Italian dressing but it was still ok.Price wise our meal was around $80 which included $4 corking fee.  However we saw on the menu if you present your theater tix you get a 10% discount!  (Another nice surprise )Parking was easy.  On street a block away.All in all a cool place with great food and great service.We'll be back.
