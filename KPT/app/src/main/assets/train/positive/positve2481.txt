The only place outside of Chicago that does a proper Chicago dog.  I love their crispy fries.  No matter how you order them you won't be disappointed.  Pub fries are our family favorite. Save yourself a few bucks and grab your own bottled beers from the beer cave. You aren't going to find a better selection of beers in the city.  Sure some places might have a larger selection of beers on tap but D's is the only place you will find 6 varieties of actual authentic French Saisons in season.  Pizza is excellent and rivals any pizza only place in Pittsburgh. Super kid friendly is the icing on the cake.
