We've been here several times and the food is always good. Nothing spectacular or amazing but always filling and tasty. Typical breakfast fare. I love anything benedict but as a veggie hate havint to pay for the ham and order it w/o ham. So a waitress here taught me a little money saving trick which I will always be grateful. Order texas toast two eggs over easy and a side of hollandaise sauce. Then build your own eggs benedict. Saves a vegetarian about $2 on a main which is great!    I would give it four stars if it weren't for the insane busy-ness of this place. It would be really great if they could expand. They also could really use chairs and benches outside for people who are waiting. I'm sure it's better during the week but as a 40 hour a week working couple weekends are the only time we can make it there.
