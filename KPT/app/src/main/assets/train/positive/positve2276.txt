Wow! The pizza was awesome! I took my family on a Monday night not very crowded (pre-MNF game time) and we ordered a 12 inch regular crust pepperoni with extra cheese and garlic pizza. It was incredible! The service was good and the waiter was very informative. The atmosphere was good. I recommend this pizza for dine in or carry out.
