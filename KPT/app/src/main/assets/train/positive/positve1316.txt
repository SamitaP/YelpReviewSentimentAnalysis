this is one of the best health food stores i've ever shopped at. the prices overall are pretty good in terms of the size and type of the store. plus there are regularly sales which help make the prices easier to swallow. the bulk and pre-made food sections are really wonderful and there is always a good selection of local produce. the staff is knowledgeable and very friendly and they give a 10cent coupon for bringing your own bags.
