My husband and I stopped going here back in 2010 because of the bad service we were receiving. We used to call the servers Whole Foods Rejects; they were always cranky and we felt not welcomed rushed. At the end of 2011 I think they got a new manager the service has been optimal and we haven't stopped going since. Their food is delicious as well as their drinks and coffee.
