I definitely love this place!  A fantastic example of a little neighborhood restaurant just serving perfect hand-made food and getting it right.  The food is so savory and just melts in your mouth.  You can't go wrong with the specials.  My only complaints (which are minor) are that parking can be a bit of an issue (street parking only) and for the love of god you need to make reservations (they get a bit shirty with you if you don't).  But these are so minor I don't even think they affect my rating at all.  The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is wonderful.
