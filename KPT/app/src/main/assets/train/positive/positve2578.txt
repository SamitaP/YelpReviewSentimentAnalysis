Ok. It started out as a rough night . 40 minutes late honoring our reservation lack of communication from management. Slow service once we did get seated. Our 8:30 reservation was not met with any food until at least 9:30. Really crazy. However it was made alllll better by our chef Tito. When we go back and we *will* go back -- we will ask for Tito.  Is he Japanese? No but he is awesome.   To apologize the manager did comp our entire meal... We were a party of 10 -- and we took good care of our servers...it really wasn't their fault. Happy Xmas eve Tito you know how to do it right. Thanks.
