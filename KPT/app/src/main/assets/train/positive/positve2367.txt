LOVE this place. Delicious hot dogs (I am loyal to the mac & cheese topped hot dog - judge me I don't care) & the most incredible fries around. I live in Regent Square & I'm thrilled to have a local go-to place for a quick dinner & a beer for very reasonable prices. They often have a $5 dog & fries lunch special that I gratefully take advantage of. Yum!
