I'm not from PA I'm from VA.  In VA I worked at a wine and beer bar where we served and I tasted some of the best beers in the world.  And in VA we don't have absurd old beer and wine control laws meaning our access to reasonably priced intelligently stocked beer is much higher than pittsburgh.  That said the best selection of beer I've found in this city has been at D's.  You will find a number of american craft brews trappist ales etc.  The only problem is the price...  which is solvable.  D's has a great system if you buy a bottle of beer to take out of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off the bottle.  This dollar off doesn't matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off are not much higher than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  The only problem is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not really seeing the issue with that but I'm sure someone will.  Also I've never eaten here because hot dogs are generally not good.  Furthermore I'm not sure why anyone would go to a hot-dog joint and expect good service.  So ignore anyone talking about hot-dogs and come here for the beer. Finally parking sucks there's a lot of very busy restaurants and businesses on the same street so expect to walk a little.
