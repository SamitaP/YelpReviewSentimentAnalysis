This is the kind of restaurant that lets the food speak for its self.  It's not fancy - the decor to me is very nostalgic as I am a relocated Pittsburgher.  The special is usually the best thing on the menu that day.  Their prices are a little high but I think for the quality it's not too bad.  I love a good BYOB restaurant... I go here a lot when I visit my parents who live on the north side and I have never ever had a bad meal.  The service is usually very good.  My only complaint was that last time they were out of wedding soup and that is my absolute favorite :)  Keep up the good work!
