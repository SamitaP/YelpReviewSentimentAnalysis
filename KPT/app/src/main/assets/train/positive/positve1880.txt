Being from Chicago I'm a pizza snob.  Yeah I know it's like comparing apples to oranges but still...this is my review for Beto's.  Anywhoo--this was a unique experience...the pizza comes out of the oven with just sauce then mozzerella is piled on for a semi-melt addition.  Who would have thought of this!? The pizza itself was good and the sauce decent but the whole semi-melt I'll have to get used to.  :-)  I'd be back for a second shot at it!
