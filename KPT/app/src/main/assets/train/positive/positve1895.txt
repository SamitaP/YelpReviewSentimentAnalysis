I absolutely LOVE betosWhen i first moved to Pittsburgh i actually hated it and refused to get the pizza so i would just stick with the Italian Hoagie..... Yummmm it is probably the best hoagie in the burgh no jokes.The pizza i grew to and i assume that some people have to do the same. But boy did i grow to it fast once i did. I remember one day just trying a slice and was in love with it. I think it has to be the sauce it is so so so so sweet and just abosultely amazing. The cheese is also amazing because it makes the hot cold sensation just that much better. I always get 2 slices 1 mushroom 1 plain and an italian hoagie with lettuce pickles mayo I truely cant wait to get back to the burgh to have some betosA down side to betos is it gets pricey if you eat alot. But hey if thats what good pizza costs then so be it im happy with it
