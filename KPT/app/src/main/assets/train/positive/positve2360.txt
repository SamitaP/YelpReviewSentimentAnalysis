I'm a vegetarian and everything but man sometimes all you want is a hot dog.  And you can get this at D's.  Every hot dog or hamburger on their menu can be ordered vegetarian which is both awesome and rare.  I ordered the Chihuahua (with avocado cheddar cheese salsa and jalapenos) and my table split an order of fries.  SO GOOD.  Almost too good.And you have to take a stroll around the beer cave.  It's not quite as impressive as I was hoping but definitely worth the splurge to make your own 6-pack.  Last time I was in I was able to purchase a 6-pack of porters - Anchor Road Dog Saranac caramel Duck-Rabbit Old Leghumper and something else I can't remember - for a friend.  I'll definitely go back.
