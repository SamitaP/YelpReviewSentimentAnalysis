This place is categorized as Portugese but I thought the menu was more Mediterranian than anything else.  Bacalhau (dried salted fish - the national dish of Portugal) was nowhere on the menu; which is just fine by me!  The restauarnt has an eclectic decor and a nice setting.  The only tough part is parking in Shadyside... but on this night I managed to get a spot right in front of the restaurant.For dinner I had lobster ravioli (a special) and my date had mushroom ravioli.  Both were outstanding.   Peering around at other tables I saw several other delectable creations that I would like to return and try.  The Peri peri chicken looked quite good.This another of the local BYOB restauarnts which makes me happy.  We brought a nice bottle of Pinot Noir which always helps to make the dining experience more pleasurable.This is an excellent find... I will be back.  Soon.
