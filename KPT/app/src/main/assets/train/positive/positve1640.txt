Once a year I treat my family to a lovely dinner at Billy's before we venture downtown to catch 1964 The Tribute at the Benedum Center.  This has become a tradition now after several years and it's always one of my favorite days of the year.  Billy's isn't anything fancy.  But it's a great place to have nearby.  Friendly people (on both sides of the bar) and a menu that's above your average bar food.  I've had several of their offerings including the Black Diamond Steak a couple of the chicken dishes and the Steak Burger as well as a few appetizer offerings.  The Black Diamond Steak is so tender it practically melts in your mouth and is served with onions and peppers.  The chicken dishes I've tried have exceeded my expectations.  And even the burger which I wouldn't normally order at Billy's was beautiful.  It was cooked just the way I wanted it (medium) and was one of the best burgers I've eaten.  I know that sounds insane but for reals that Steak Burger blew my mind.  I never expected it to be so good.  I mean I was just expecting your average burger.  Nope once again Billy's impresses.  It's the perfect way to start a perfect night on the town.  The service is always friendly and attentive too regardless of how busy they are.  And considering the quality of the meal and the great service the prices are very reasonable.  With it's location not far from downtown but far enough away that you don't usually have to worry about a crowd I'm surprised more people don't check it out before a show in the Cultural District.
