I have to say that I've only been here when it was very busy. I found the service fairly quick and any of the food I've had has been delicious. I went there tonight and there was an issue with my food. Without going into detail I will say they handled it wonderfully. Our waitress Mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem. I had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time. I had one beer that's similar to a blue moon and that was good too. I would go back again!
