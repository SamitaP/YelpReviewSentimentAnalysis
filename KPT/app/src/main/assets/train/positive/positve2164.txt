Ladies and Gentleman welcome to pancake heaven. It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.I know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them they are odd and moist and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset and am now forever changed. The Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes or undercooked globs of batter but instead sweet fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the Egg Combo: 2 hot cakes eggs and bacon/sausage. Go all out you deserve it. On a recent visit I also discovered the french toast menu which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. I've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. This place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop. Make sure you arrive early on a weekend morning to avoid the crowd! Or wake up at dawn on a weekday and partake (as I have been known to do from time to time!)
