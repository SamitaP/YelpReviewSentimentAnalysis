For my group of friends this is the ultimate post-5K run reward!Here are the rules (they are my rules but you should adopt them for Dor-Stop success):1. Go only with 2-4 people (otherwise you are one of THOSE parties that will hold everything up and screw up the seating)2. Be prepared to wait.  If you do not wait consider yourself the luckiest person alive.3. Order something savory (may I recommend the Breakfast Burrito or the Eggs Benedict?  Everything has a twist and a funny name so you're going to spend some time actually reading the menu.  Get something special don't just go with scrambled eggs and bacon - although I'm sure that's delicious too).4. Order specialty pancakes for the table (to share).  We haven't been able to get away from the drawing power of the pumpkin pancakes yet.  They are so thick yet so fluffy at the same time!The surprising news: they take credit cards (it gives off a cash only vibe).The opportunity area: syrup that does not come in an old-fashioned squeeze bottle!  It takes me about 15 minutes to get the disgusting amount of syrup I want atop my fluffy pancakes.
