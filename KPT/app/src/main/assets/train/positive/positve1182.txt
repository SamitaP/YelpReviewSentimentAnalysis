The Quiet Storm is one of the coolest places in Pittsburgh. Not only for food but for the atmosphere and milkshakes!  If you are looking for a place to bring your parents in-laws uptight but good-hearted neighbors -don't let the hipster decor and server fashions lead you to think it will be a shouting match over noise music and avoiding awkward half-nude paintings the food is genuinely delicious and the space objectively interesting.I recommend the grilled cheese with apple and cream cheese although both times I've gotten it it's been a little heavy on the cream cheese so if you are conscious about that kind of thing ask for light cream cheese. I also absolutely love the buffalo tofu tenders bread sticks and the mac n' cheese. Also don't forget about their extensive and interesting drink menu! Lavender lemonade root beer and espresso? Sounds delicious to me and makes me wonder when The Quiet Storm will be getting a liquor license...the answer my friend is blowing in the wind...
