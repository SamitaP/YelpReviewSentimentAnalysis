This place has a Beer Cave!  Seriously that's what they call it.  We got to go in and select the beer of our choice from shelves and shelves of single bottles everything from Bud to Hoegaarden to Chimay and back again.  So many beers I've never even heard of.Anyway they have hot dogs too...soooo many choices.  I came with a group and we all easily satisfied our hot dog cravings.  I had the veggie dog with cheese tomatoes and dill pickles and it was so so yummy.  Everyone else was thrilled with their dogs as well.  We also got cheese fries with ranch dipping sauce fried zucchini and onion rings...and heart attacks...just kidding but damn what a greasy meal of awesomeness!
