It's nice to have a local resturant/bar that you can walk to. Cain's is ours. The service is always friendly and good. The prices are fair and it is always clean. I would have given it five stars instead of four but some nights the food is better than others. I think it depends on who is cooking on a given night. It is never bad sometimes it is great. Thursday night's prime rib specials are particularly good.
