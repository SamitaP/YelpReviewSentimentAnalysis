I just got lunch from here today.  For $9.63 I got soup salad vegetables tempura 6 avocado rolls steamed rice and pickles.  It was a ton of food and more than filling enough - I didn't even eat the salad and I was stuffed.  I will agree that the wasabi was pretty weak - I added tons of it and it added almost no spice or flavor.  Even though it was a bit pricier than I was expecting (my menu was outdated and said the lunch would be $6.95.  Oops.) it was also very filling and worth it for a once-in-a-while treat.
