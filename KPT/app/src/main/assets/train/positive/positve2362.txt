D's Oh D's.  What a fun place to hang out walk thru the beer cave and drool...also select a few beers to go.While it is not gourmet U can have a gourmet dog.  The root beer is great too.  So bring the kids.  Friendly but gruff service! lol!  Try the fries with chili or cheese! or the pimped up Pub fries!  Yum!   They have other food but I tend to get a dog my fav is the Chicago Dog.
