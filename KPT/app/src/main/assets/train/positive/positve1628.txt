Who doesn't love good well baked bread? Bread Works is very good bread in dozens of varieties. I'm partial to their old fashioned salt sticks with caraway seeds a long time Pittsburgh tradition. Great dinner rolls loaves sausage rolls and lots of other items. This place also delivers to local restaurants so you've probably had their products and not known.
