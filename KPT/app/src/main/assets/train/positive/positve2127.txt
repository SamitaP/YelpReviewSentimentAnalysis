The Dor-Stop is amazing. I recommend it to everyone who wants a good breakfast. They have the best pancakes I have ever had. You usually don't even need syrup. The service is good -- the servers are attentive and professional but there's a mom-and-pop feel about it too. I travel from an hour away to visit about once a month or so. It's that worth it. Reasonably priced.The only drawback is they don't have real maple syrup. (Only Cracker Barrel seems to in the US but that's just the Canadian in me.)  There are usually pretty long lines waiting for tables; but miraculously the wait is so short -- even on holidays.Other than that: favorite. breakfast. restaurant.
