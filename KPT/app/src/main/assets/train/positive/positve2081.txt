My dad and I do a yearly trip to a different city to see the NY Mets play.  Yeah I'm a Mets fan and live in California.  Anyway back in May of 2012 we made the trip to Pittsburgh.  Based on Yelp and local recommendations we drove out to the Dor-Stop.  In the four days we were in Pittsburgh we ended up going two times for breakfast.  Just awesome pancakes.   First time I got the banana pancakes and my dad got the oatmeal raisin.  I love banana pancakes and these were pretty good.  But the oatmeal raisin were fantastic.  Next time both of us got oatmeal pancakes.  I opted for no raisins.  On a side note we frequently hit restaurants covered on DDD but I no longer trust that show based on some of my experiences and the Yelp reviews I've read.   I now will look up the Yelp review and ask locals if the restaurant is featured on DDD before going.
