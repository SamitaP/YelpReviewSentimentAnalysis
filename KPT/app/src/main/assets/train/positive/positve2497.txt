Yes. As the previous folks have said Dunnings is really nothing special in terms of what most people percieve as a special dining experience. I beg to differ. I always have great prompt service and the same window seat every time I come here. Then again I always come in the middle of the afternoon and only order one drink and the French Onion Soup. However I have had dinner here before.I like Dunnings because it is not tying to be anything other than an old school family friendly bar-restuarant. It is a Regent Square staple and the folks that come here seem to be staples as well. There is a Cheers vibe (early 80's sitcomabout a Boston bar where everyone knows your name) and that seems to fare very well with the local residents. After living in Los Angeles for all of my 20's I find this kind of environment comforting and  refreshing.For the life of me I cannot remember what I had for dinner here. I guess that may be a testament to the mediocre food.So if you are looking for a low key mellow old school (dark wood framed pictures of landscapes a'la Rembrandt) place to check out have a casual drink and appetizer Dunnings is your spot.   I feel bad that the previous folks had crappy service but if you come here with an open mind and the correct expectations you will love this place as much as I do.Also it is Regent Theater adjacent so it is also the perfect spot to have a quick drink/ appetizer before a film.
