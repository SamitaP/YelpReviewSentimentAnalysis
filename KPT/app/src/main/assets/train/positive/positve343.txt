This place is quite big with a bar area dining room area and patio area. We decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many TV's. They also have darts and two pool tables which I really enjoy. When you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool. I ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat both of which are brewed by Rock Bottom. They both tasted delicious and were exactly what I needed for a hot day. My friend ordered the Fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share. It was a pretty delicious meal but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which I am not really a fan of. I ordered the Sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried. The salad was okay I was expecting more flavors overall but I didn't really get them. It was a good experience and will most likely be back when I am around the waterfront area.
