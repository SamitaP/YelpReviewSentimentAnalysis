This was a solid stop for a lunch with my grandma and my mother.  As we drove by my mother said Oh Cain's that place brings back memories.  So I told her to pull on over because we were going in.After seeing the abundant sauces I had to go with the wings.  I was very happy with them.  The sauces were plentyful and very different.  I got the mild garlic parm and the signature Mean Green which was a mix of peppers.  Both were delicious and came with carrots celery and ranch free of charge!!My mom's mushroom chicken wrap was huge and delicious and her sweet potato waffle fries were great.  They could have been a little more crispy but that is just how I like them.Now my grandma's sandwich was good but it were the homemade chips that had me in love.  They were phenomenal.  Next time I night jut make a meal out of their chips.
