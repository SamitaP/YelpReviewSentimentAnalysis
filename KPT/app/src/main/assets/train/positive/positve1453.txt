So if you are reading this read no further tell your girlfriend/fiance/wife or whoever - you've made up your mind you're going. Until further notice this may be the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. This has everything I look for in a restaurant - charming atmosphere great cocktails good service and most importantly amazing food. I had the Veal Milanese and would have a hard time ordering something else next time. This was by far the best veal dish I have ever had and at $65 I would almost call this a steal. The vodka sauce pasta starter that comes with it is wonderful in and of itself and the salad the salad is spectacular! That's the thing about this place not a single aspect of the meal disappoints or falls short of amazing. I did not order an appetizer as I had to send some of the pasta back as well as some of the veal because I just couldn't eat it all - this will feel like a sin but what can you do. I am sure the appetizers are amazing as well. Lets not forget the martini that I would say is about the best you're going to find in the Burgh! Not to mention it's BYOB I brought my favorite bottle of California red wine to take the guess work out of the wine selection and guarantee an amazing amazing meal. (If you know your Italian wines and that's your thing then I would forget the BYOB)Bottom line - this is the proverbial no-brainer enjoy
