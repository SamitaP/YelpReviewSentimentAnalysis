D's has long been a stand-by for a good veggie hotdog and a nice beer selection for me. It has reasonable bar food and a reasonably priced wide selection of beer. My meat-eating friends seem to really like the wings and various meat hotdogs and burgers.It is always very crowded during peak dinner times even early in the week in my experience. Extpect a long wait on weekends for sure! D's is a comfortable place to go for me and attracts a young-ish crowd but not to young. The atmosphere is lively and casual.Service can be slow but the servers are always friendly. Overall this is a good casual food place. The walk-in beer cooler and additional beer selection are a draw as well. They do have some vegetarian options as well which I always appreciate.
