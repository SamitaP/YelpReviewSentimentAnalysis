In the last week I've been here twice partially because I don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! It's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.I tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than Sharp Edge's. The sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. To wash it down I had Loose Cannon beer how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!Our waitress was a little slow she said it was her first night. Who makes a new girl work on a Friday night! She seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end or maybe it's because I wasn't hungry anymore so I didn't care.The beer was pricy - Tuesday night I had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer...
