The best hot dog I've had. Ever. I also have to say trying to decide which hot dog I wanted was by far one of the hardest decisions I have had to make (food-wise). Eventually I got the chihuahua dog because it was out of the box and I wanted try something new. It comes with avocado spread salsa cheddar cheese and jalapenos. The dog itself was perfectly crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside and really just the best I have had. The toppings were great and I was happy I gave it a try. My friend got the bacon and cheese dog. I was expecting bacon bit type bacon but they were full strips of bacon that were perfectly crisp and the melted cheese was right on. I am certainly going to come back and try a new hot dog. I am very exciting to finally have a hot dog place that I know produces fantastic tasting hot dogs. I would definitely recommend you give this place a try.
