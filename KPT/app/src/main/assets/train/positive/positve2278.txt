An impromptu party/picnic in the yard.   Lots of kids and friends stopped by to see an old neighbor that was in town visiting.  All of a sudden it was time to eat.  Little Nipper's to the rescue.   Ordered a few different style pizza's and some wings.  Nice crust not thin but not to thick the sauce is tasty cheese was nice... gummy stringy good.  The pizza's disappeared fast.  The wings were good and a little crunchy just right.
