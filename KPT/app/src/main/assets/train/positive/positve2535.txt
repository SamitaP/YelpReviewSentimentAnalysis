I'll make this short and sweet.  I grew up in the Pittsburgh area and now have retired at the central California Coast. I have tried hoagies throughout the United States and the hoagies made at the Triangle Bar in Swissvale are BY FAR the absolute best hoagies in the United States of America!!!!  When I go back and visit Pittsburgh the Triangle Bar is a MUST stop and I usually buy a couple of extra hoagies so that I can bring them home on the plane to California and enjoy them here!!!The Best of the Best!!!!!!!!!!!
