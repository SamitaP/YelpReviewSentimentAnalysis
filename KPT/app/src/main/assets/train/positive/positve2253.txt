How have I not written a review for this place yet? I LOVE Bado's. It's right down the street from one of my old schools so I have a lot of fond memories of eating here once a week or so with my mom during the school's lunch break. With that in mind because I often come here craving pizza and I was a child patron I tend to just forget that oh yeah: I can get alcohol as well. That said my family has actually purchased six-packs from the bar since Bado's is easier to get to than a beer distributor so yes I'd say they have a decent beer selection if we're taking the time to buy and carry a six pack home.One of my favorite things from Bado's is actually their calzones which are enormous and yet oddly enough light. No not light in calories but light in the amount of grease and oils in the meal. This of course is compared to take-out chains so I'm sure it's still way too much for a meal to be considered healthy. But still I've always felt that their calzones have the perfect blend of toppings sauces and so forth and they're borderline divine. The pizza is delicious as well and Bado's also has a bunch of other meal options like sandwiches soups and salads so you're sure to find something here.Just keep in mind Bado's is popular and it gets crowded. Fast. Be prepared for a wait or try to show up during slow hours i.e. not right after work - especially on a Friday. But really other than that I can't complain about this place. In fact just talking about it makes me crave pizza...mmmmmm.
