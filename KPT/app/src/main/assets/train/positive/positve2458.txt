This place is great! As a vegan and not a huge fan of beer I wasn't expecting much for me there from D's name...but the service food and atmosphere was all so so good!I was excited to try their cauliflower wings but it turned out that they have now switched over to seitan. Even so the two different orders my friends and I shared were both very tasty although very fried and crunchy compared to the meatier seitan wings served up elsewhere in Pittsburgh.Their vegan dog on a poppy seed bun comes with unlimited toppings for just 4.99! They somehow managed to get avocado grilled onions tomato pickle spears brown mustard and banana peppers stacked into mine and it was delicious and filling. I'd love to see a homemade vegan dog instead of using Yve's but the toppings deal makes it worth it!Definitely will be back for more :)
