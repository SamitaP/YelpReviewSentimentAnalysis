I was really excited to try D's Six Pax and Dogs. But from the moment my friend and I walked in on a Friday at lunch time we were kind of bummed.  We sat down at the bar and the bartender refused to even acknowledge us let alone serve us.  So we switched to the other side of the space.The service on the other side was better but a tad slow.  I started with the macaroni and cheese ($3.00).  It was just doctored Kraft mac and cheese with a bit too much salt but for the price is was reasonable and good.  I ordered a Chicago dog ($5.50) and the hot dog was an all star for the most part.  It was an authentic Chicago style dog and the toppings were fantastic.  My friend ordered a Big Ben hot dog and it was pretty gross.  The cheese picked up the vinegar-y taste from the coleslaw and it made the cheese taste sour.  Not appetizing at all.  D's grills their hot dogs which is normally fine.  However both my friend and my dogs came out very burnt.  One of hers was literally inedible and these hot dogs are pricey.  The server did not say anything about the practically untouched hot dog and just took it off of the table.They do have some daily or lunch specials for cheaper hot dogs so check that out.The verdict?  I would come back here for a Chicago dog and ask them to boil it to prevent the risk of a singed dog and I would return for the beer cave.
