We decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to Casbah.  We were surprised  by the huge tent covering the outdoor dining area.  We opted for an inside table the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  For brunch you are served your choice of drink appetizer and entree.  For our drinks BJ had a Bloody Mary and I had a Bellini.  We were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  For appetizers we got a Three Sisters Farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  Very good.  For entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the NY strip steak.  Very relaxing and tasty meal.
