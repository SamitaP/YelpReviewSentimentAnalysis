Who knew french fries came on salads? Pittsburgh did.Salads are good. Pizza looked tasty. Service is helpful (when you can find it).The pepper steak salad is pretty good - get it with ranch. Or instead just get a plate of those garlic knots. They're the best thing there.And the comment about helpful service - when I went to pay the bill it was too windy for me to leave it out on the table. Instead I went inside and it was a no-man's land. No person working could be found for a good three minutes while I stood there with my bill in hand. I mean what kind of place is dead empty of all wait staff bartenders or any person who worked there for that long during the lunch rush? Seems odd.
