I will admit the chipped ham sandwich was good. It was tender and salty and soft on the wheat bread. But this is just a deli. More like a bodega than anything actually. The signage is classic and the neighborhood especially Ohio Street is a delight. Isaly's is a Pittsburgh legend but more sentiment for yesteryear than anything.
