My in-laws saw the Dor-Stop on DDD and wanted to try it out. When I found out they were famous for their pancakes I hopped right on board. We went on a Sunday morning and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. After about 10 four seats opened up at the counter so we snagged them. We got to know the staff as we perused the menu. We were right next to the cash register and the (I'm assuming) owner was a gentle drill sergeant doling out orders. I had the banana chocolate chip pancakes with a side of sausage. The three generously-sized pancakes were sweet with a crispy edge and were loaded with fruit and chocolate. Ohmygod. Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I stuffed myself silly knowing I wouldn't be able to come back next weekend and do it all again. The sausage patties were really tasty and not greasy at all. I had to fend off T who kept getting samples. :) I also tried T's apple cinnamon pancakes which had dollops of apple pie filling and just the right amount of cinnamon. My father-in-law had the strawberry-stuffed French toast and my mother-in-law had the walnut French toast. I didn't try either but they looked amazing. I would DEFINITELY come back here if I lived in the area. Pay no mind to the wait time. Bring a book bring someone you love to chat with. It's worth it!
