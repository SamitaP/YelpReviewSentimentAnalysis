I love this place. Normally it would have been 4.5 stars but since they moved to a smoke free environment it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick friendly and very with it. This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas which apart from the strawberry crepes doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!
