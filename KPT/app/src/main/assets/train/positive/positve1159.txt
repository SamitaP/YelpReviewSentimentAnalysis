YUMMM.  Read the Yelp reviews before coming so I knew to get the ginger lemonade and hangover hash.  Both were amazing filling AND i got to use the wifi there for a couple hours on a Sunday morning with no nasty looks from the staff (it was crowded but no line).  Totally worth any effort it takes to get there (seemed to be in the middle of nowhere I had a couple mile walk to get there.)
