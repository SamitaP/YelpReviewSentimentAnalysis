I too stumbled upon this place while visiting a relative who was at Allegheny General and I've subsequently visited her before/after Pirate games. I can't say enough good things about this place.  The pizza was great.  The subs were awesome and the primanti-style deli sandwiches compare with the original.  But not only was the food great the prices were very reasonable.  Every time I've been there we've gotten the specials on the menu (which usually include combinations of pizza sandwiches and drinks) and we've fed parties of 5-8 adults for under $20-$30.Also the service is great.  The two women that run the place couldn't have been more pleasant - and even compassionate when we mentioned the person in the hospital.Be warned though it's not in the greatest location.  E Ohio Street isn't the best neighborhood and the place looks like a hole in the wall.  But don't be scared its definitely the best place in the area BY FAR! Other places in the neighborhood may look nicer on the outside (e.g. Peanutz) but please don't waste your time.
