Legends is good...but not special. It's just your typical Italian-American restaurant but with a shorter menu than most. Huge portions of pasta as expected. Started with Mussels Diablo which were good but we had a lot of closed shells. I had the Penne alla Vodka and the sauce was good especially with fresh basil leaves. The pasta was a bit overcooked. Basically if you're Italian you know how to make this food at home. That doesn't make it bad just A-OK!The party next to us brought a bottle of grape Pucker vodka and tonic water as their BYOB. Hey whatever works...
