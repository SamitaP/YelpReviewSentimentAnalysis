Tiny little ordinary looking Beto's somehow manages to be an interesting pizza place. How? Well remember the pizza lunchables you used to get as a kid where you put all the cold toppings on top of your little pizza shell? That's essentially Beto's pizza only about 50 times better obviously. It comes in massive slices with cheese and toppings spilling out all over the place. Their sandwiches are massive and delicious. (They will toss those in the oven to melt the cheese.) The place is super tiny and it can be difficult to find a table but we've never been left standing and I've been there a decent amount normally with the Sunday lunch crowd.
