Moved to Pittsburgh from Philly a year ago. Our standard for restaurants is if it were in Philly would be go back. The answer for Cafe Zinho is YES.  One of the only excellent restaurants in the City (along with Salt and Dish). If you find the Big Burrito empire restaurants and their coy cats lackluster and are looking for something outstanding go here. Cozy BYO and excellent food particularly if you go with the Portuguese items on the menu.  Our faves were the sardines to start and the fish stew for a main (OMG good).  Okay in Philly I would give this four starts but for Pittsburgh 5.
