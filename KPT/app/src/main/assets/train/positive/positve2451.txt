Wonderful place for a great casual meal! Their Beer Cave and excellent make your own 6-pack/draft beer selection are well known. As someone who was not able to drink I was equally impressed by their delicious rootbeer also on draft. We had the Vegetarian Pub Fries to start which was a large helping of french fries smothered in cheese and avocado with a side of ranch. I had the Chihuahua hot dog with a veggie hot dog and added grilled onions and my partner had a specialty Octoberfest hot dog. Both were large and delicious. We did not have to wait long for a Friday night and the service was excellent. The space tends to be crowded so this is not the place to go for a quiet fancy dinner but the food and drinks were excellent and we will definitely be back.
