I have been frequenting Alla Famiglia since 2007 and it is still my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps my favorite in the world!  Chef Jonathan is a genius - his Veal Chop Milanese with lump crab toasted pine nuts and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  Every time we eat here my husband orders this dish and refuses to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.  I have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!  You have got to try the following:  mozzarella (apptz) hot peppers (apptz) mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz) vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal - sauce is delicious) veal chop milanese (entr√©e).  You won't be disappointed - the kitchen is open so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.  Make a reservation.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so be careful.  PS.  I've taken all my friends family and business partners (many who do not live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely loves it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  In fact we no longer live in Pittsburgh but every time we come into town for a visit we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite Alla Famiglia!
