Ok to ALL the hipsters and east end snobs... everything can't be oh so trendy and veganese.  I say that with love as I have my foothold in the trendy hipster scene as well.   Dunnings is GREAT.  Great Pittsburgh fare at reasonable prices since when did $10 become too much for a burger?  I highly recommend anything fried or on a bun from Dunnings you will not be disappointed.   When it comes to the dinner selections I think it just depends on the cook in the kitchen.  The service is friendly the decor is old school but well maintained.   I just get so frustrated with a lot of these comments because it seems like a lot of the yelpers excpect gold dust when they spend upwards of $5.
