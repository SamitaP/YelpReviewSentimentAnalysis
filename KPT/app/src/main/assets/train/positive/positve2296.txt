Made my first trip to D's today.  By far one of the best bars I have been to.  Great atmosphere good food for a bar and how can I not mention the BEER CAVE.  They have an impeccable selection of brew.  Great place to go for a night out or just to have a good time.  I would imagine a Stiller game would be pretty fun to watch.  The prices are just right including drinks but if only we could do something about the county drink tax.  I will visit this place frequently.
