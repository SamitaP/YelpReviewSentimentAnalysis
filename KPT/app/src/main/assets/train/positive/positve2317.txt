To speak ill of D's would be blasphemy to any true Pittsburgher. It really doesn't get much better if you're in the mood for pub grub. Pizza is awesome the fries are amazing - I'm going to go as far as saying better than Potato Patch - they are so crispy and not swimming in grease! What is their magic method? The burgers and dogz - all gluttonous goodies and you can get them all veggie style. If you're watching your waist line you may want to skip this place...but I say go ahead and treat yourself! Oh! And did I mention the beer selection isn't too shabby? Watermelon beer in the summer...mouth watering.
