Panera is the best option for fast food in my opinion. I love Panera for lunch and dinner.It's hard to go wrong with Panera. You can eat pretty healthy here if you try. Not everything is healthy but there definitely are options. I also like that they use fresh ingredients and antibiotic free chicken. In my opinion you can't go wrong with their soups they are my favorite. Some are better for you than others like the vegetable pesto and black bean soups however if you get a you pick two meal you can splurge on the less healthy ones like creamy wild rice and chicken. What is a you pick two you ask? It is a meal you create by picking two items from soups salads sandwiches paninis and pastas. You get a half of each selection that you pick which is nice to try some of their different menu items. I feel like their breakfast treats leave more to be desired and their coffee is so so. I generally wouldn't come here for breakfast. Their pastries do not have enough flavor to me they taste rather doughy. For this reason alone is why I am giving them four stars! Other than that they are great!
