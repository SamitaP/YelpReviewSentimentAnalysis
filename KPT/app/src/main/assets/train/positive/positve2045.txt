This restaurant was featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network and was the basis of our visit. Located in the cute neighbourhood in the South part of Pittsburgh Dormont this little diner has a full breakfast and lunch menu. We got there just in an hour before they were closing for some lunch! I ordered the turkey Reuben with latkes as a side. It was delish! The sandwich had the right amount of sauerkraut. Their pancakes looked wonderful will have to order them the next time I am in the area. Add this place to your list when you visit Pittsburgh!
