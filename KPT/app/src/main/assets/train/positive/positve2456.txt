Now that we do not live in Pittsburgh; D's is a must go to when we are back in town.  Their main specialty is beer and that is what I always have so I can not speak to any liquor or wine options.  The beer selection is awesome.  They have over 1000 different kinds of beer.  You just have to make your selection and they will open it for you at your table.  You can also create your own mix and match 6 pack to carry out.  Now on to the food.  If you get french fries - I am warning you the portion is very large.  The ones with bacon and cheese are a great.  We tried both the wet and dry wings and were happy with both.  Now the reason we came here; the hot dogs.  And oh are they amazing.   They have hot dogs combinations on the menu but you can also create any combination that you want.  I am a HUGE fan of the Chicago Dog - they do it right!!!  On a side note - if you like Root Beer they have a great root beer on draft.  They do offer a children's menu as well and it is completely fine for children in the middle of the day.  You see tons of families.  The staff has always been very friendly and helpful.  They know their beer and food very well!If you have never been here; I recommend it.
