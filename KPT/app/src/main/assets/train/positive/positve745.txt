When you're in the mood for a good ol' fashioned nothin' fancy Italian restaurant you can't beat Minutello's!  My husband Rick and I didn't feel like cooking the other night so we came here for a nice casual dinner.  Man I haven't reviewed this place in nearly three years and it sure hasn't changed.  Still has that good old basement decor.Minutello's still has some of the best pizza in town.  Rick and I ordered the Supreme wtih capicola Italian Sausage salami and pepperoni!  Mm-mm good!  Gotta hit that gym tomorrow.  And you know the best thing about ordering pizza don't you?  It's always good the second day!
