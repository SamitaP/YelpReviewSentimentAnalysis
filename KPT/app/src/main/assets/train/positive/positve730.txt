Went here last night for takeout since our normal place is currently renovating their kitchen. We ordered fried dumplings which were just ok. We also ordered some shrimp lo mein and general tsos chicken. These were some of the best entrees that I have gotten from a takeout place. The lo mein was perfectly cooked and was not greasy at all. The shrimp were also cooked perfectly. The general tsos may be some of my favorite I have ever gotten. It wasn't spicy like I requested but the chicken was still crispy after having to drive it home and the sauce was very savory. Overall I probably will crave the food from here and will be back on a night when I do not mind driving to pick up.
