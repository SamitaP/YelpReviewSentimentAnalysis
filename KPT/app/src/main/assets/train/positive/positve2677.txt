With Pittsburgh's lack of Bagel places Panera fits the bill perfectly. Asiago Cheese bagels are some of the best i've ever eaten. Try toasting them under the broiler then rubbing them with a little raw garlic and dip into a good extra virgin olive oil.Great soups and sandwiches. Good people at the counter!
