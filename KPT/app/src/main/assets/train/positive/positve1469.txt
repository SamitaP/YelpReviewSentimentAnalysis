For convenient take-out chinese this place is the bomb. My judge of Chinese take-out depends on the quality of their hot & sour soup. This soup is lovely with big chunks of tofu and little mushrooms floating throughout it - though I'd prefer some more exotic mushrooms thrown in too. Overall this place has quick service and throws in lots of big chunks of fresh vegetables. When's the last time you had vegetable fried rice with chunks of bell pepper broccoli pea pods and onion. The Kung Pao chicken could be spicier but next time I'll ask. The Allentown neighborhood of  No. 1 China House is its major detractor. I'd be concerned about safety heading up there at night. For delivery however you'll get all your basics quickly and be happy with your order.
