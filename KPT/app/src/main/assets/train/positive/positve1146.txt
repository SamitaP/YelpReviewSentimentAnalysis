I eat at this place at least once a week.  No longer cash only which is nice since I never have any.  As a vegan I like that I have a ton of options here but that my meat-eating boyfriend is happy too.  Food is a little pricey and if you get more than an entree and coffee it's easy to quickly rack up quite a bill for such a modest seeming place.  My only real complaint is the inconsistency of the service.  It's totally hit or miss.  I've never felt targeted with attitude but I have experienced long waits for the menu coffee water the check - but weirdly never the food. Most of the time I leave happy sometimes irritated but I'm always full and ready for a nap.
