Well looks like I'm adding yet another 5-star review for Dor-Stop. But hey they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.I actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday the place was fairly empty which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.But on to the food the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better) and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.Buuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did too because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here understandably so. Well I got my food brought it home and proceeded to devour it. Just YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!If I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet buuuuut...I can't hold it against them. I just can't. Not after that french toast. See you next time Dor-Stop!
