Sandy had me holed up in Pittsburgh looking for a flight and staying with my wife's aunt. She adventurously agreed to go with me to a veggie place and that's how I ended up here. Nice layout with tables along the windows and more in back. If you're not familiar with this kind of scene it could seem a little rundown but to my eyes it was fine. Really it's kind of the proto-typical East Coast college town vegetarian hangout.The aunt-in-law is a meateater and in her seventies but she really enjoyed her tempeh Cubano. And she loved her lavender lemonade. No room for dessert though.I got the Banh Mi and it was very tasty. 'Nuff said.The service was in my mind delightful. The server was engaging and welcoming to my somewhat timorous companion explaining the dishes to her and making a recommendation that worked out. He was efficient and personable.Too bad I won't be back in Pittsburgh anytime soon or I would make a repeat visit for sure.
