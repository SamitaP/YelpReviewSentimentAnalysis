If you love Pittsburgh sports & classic Pittsburgh food / beer you will love this place!  First the atmosphere is great because you're surrounded by Pittsburgh sports memorabilia.  The food is excellent. I've gone here for lunch many times & have always loved my meal.  Today I had the special: clam-chowder soup tuna fish sandwich & tater-tots. Yum!!Friendly service & reasonable prices!
