I wish someone would just put a bag over her head and knock her up so I can get some grandkids.  In addition to the usual hotcakes and eggs apparently our waitress' daughter was a daily special that morning.Preferring that all of the eggs in my social life remain unfertilized I opted instead for the Italian Breakfast Club which turned out to be the dog's bollocks.  And for good reason; If you want to enjoy eating here it is highly recommend that you not use the nutritional info calculator on E'nP's website.  After checking the stats on my breakfast I now realize I should have ordered it with a side of Lipitor.Added bonus -- as a consolation prize for not taking her daughter home our waitress hooked us up with some free cookies for the road.---Cliff Notes version: dining at Eat'n Park is kind of like going to Denny's but without the shame.
