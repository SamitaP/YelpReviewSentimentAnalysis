After being told by a few friends who grew up in Dormont that this is the best I decided to give it a try. I walked in and ordered a large pep. and sausage. I'm sad to say however I was expecting much more considering some of the hype I was hearing. The pizza was just ok in my book my favorite part being the small spicy pepperoni. As I ate I watched an Italian sub being assembled. As soon as I saw that peice of capicola...  I new I screwed up there using the good stuff. To each his own I guess. I will return but not for the pizza.
