Best German food I've ever had. Hubby and I stopped here thinking we'd just have a few beers and grab a bite to eat but we were surprised to say the least. Everything is made in house which is enough to win me over. We started with the sausage and cheese plate paired with the bread basket. Homemade honey mustard gouda Swiss and the best kielbasa we've ever had the pleasure to bite into. Just as we're polishing off our plate and rubbing our full stomachs our entrees came. The schnitzel was to die for as was the rabbit both smothered in homemade mushroom gravy. The sauerkraut was a perfect combination of savory and acidic. The potato pancakes topped with homemade applesauce and some sour cream were just... Wow. I would definitely recommend getting the beer sampler awesome deal and a great way to try all of their German beers without going overboard. We'll be back for sure.
