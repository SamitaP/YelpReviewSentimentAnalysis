I think the quality and flavor of the food keeps me coming back even though the old woman is very unpleasant I have never been there when there was more than three or four people in the whole restaurant. I don't know how long they could survive and that is unfortunate.  On one occasion I was waited on by a young man who was very friendly and pleasant  where did he go? This place has potential but the old lady must go.
