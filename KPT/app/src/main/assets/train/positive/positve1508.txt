Max's Allegheny Tavern is one of the best restaurants in all of Pittsburgh. It's an ideal place to take friends and families. The food is a bit pricey (by my cheap standards) but you get a TON of it so it's absolutely worth it. It's a restaurant that stays true to the Northside's Allegheny City roots.The Max Burger is a classic. The Northside Ham and Swiss is great if you want something light. The schnitzels are ideal if you need something a little more filling. They also offer a beer sampler and some very good desserts. The spatzle and kasa spatzle go well with everything and they're fine by themselves!To those who are interested Max's has an original cocktail-style Donkey Kong/Galaga arcade game that takes quarters.Like with Amani Max's IS wheelchair accessible but the ramp is INSIDE the restaurant. There is a host on duty by the door who will set it up.
