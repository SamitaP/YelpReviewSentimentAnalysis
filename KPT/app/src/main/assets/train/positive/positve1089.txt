Excellent prix fixe brunch with impressive service. One of the best brunch deals in Pittsburgh: two courses and a drink for under $30 and their selection has something for everyone.  I love their patio ambiance as well as their basement set-up. Great place to take visitors or for special occasions.I'm a huge seafood person so the first time I ordered a Bloody Mary with the smoked salmon to start and sea scallop fry as my main.  I'm a fan of their Bloody it's spicy and flavorful. The smoked salmon was filling enough that it's easy to split and the truffled potato cake served with it melts in your mouth. The sea scallop fry is everything you would expect almost too much food but no complaints.My second trip to Casbah brunch I went with my old favorite of the smoked salmon but split it with my friend who ordered the cheese plate. Also I ordered the Braised Lamb & Eggs as my main based on friends' recommendations. It's honestly to die for. Rich and flavorful in the best way attributed to the tarragon sauce and the slow roasted lamb and easily their specialty. If you want to order something you can't get anywhere else order this. It's very filling and rich especially if you get a filling first course. Have only been here for brunch and looking forward to trying their lunch/dinner!
