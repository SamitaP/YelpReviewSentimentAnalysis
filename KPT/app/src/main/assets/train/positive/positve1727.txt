I have been to Atria locations around the city - but this was my first time at the Atria's location at PNC Park on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. My young professional group had an event there last night so it was a good chance to check it out. Our event was held upstairs and since we had a small group they wouldn't guarantee the private room downstairs. It worked for the most part but those of us that sat in the back had trouble hearing the speakers and the lights were dim. The noise from the diners downstairs plus the house music carried through and at times it was very loud and hard to hear. I would say that it's a good place for a group dinner but not for a speaking event. I can't comment on food/drink as I didn't have any. The atmosphere is nice BUT I wasn't too impressed with the layout of the whole place. Didn't see to have a good flow to it. Also the bathrooms upstairs where our event was were out of order so everyone had to go downstairs to use the restrooms.
