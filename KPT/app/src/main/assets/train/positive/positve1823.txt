Honestly it's pretty unassuming from the outside. Inside it's a tiny greek diner albeit some Americanized choices on the menu. Hello buffalo chicken gyro!But if you are craving for a fixin' of some stuffed cabbage potato pierogies or halushki this is your place. And for dirt cheap too. I think our total bill was like $10. Obviously you'll get the traditional gyro's here as well with the twist of the buffalo chicken one. Obviously I'm intrigued. They also sell ice cream which if I wasn't so full from my meal I definitely would have indulged in!
