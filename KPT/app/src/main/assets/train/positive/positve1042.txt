Oh I love this place.  It has a great menu and wine list.  It has all the great dishes with a touch of flare.  I took this meal to seafood town from start to finish and have no regrets.  The staff was really friendly - realized I was there for a special occasion and brought out a desert that said congratulations - the little things.We dined outside and I felt tucked away in a Europe-esque atmosphere for a few hours.It is worth reserving a spot on the patio to get the full experience.
