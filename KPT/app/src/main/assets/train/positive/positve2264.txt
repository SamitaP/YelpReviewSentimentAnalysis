Bado's is a quintessential Pittsburgh pizza stop. I may even consider it the best pizza in Pittsburgh! I hadn't been in since 2008 or so which was pre-food allergies for me. My friends got pizza and said it was the best they had had in a long long time. I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the toppings.If you've read some of my other reviews you know I have 14 food allergies. This makes it almost impossible to dine anywhere but when a restaurant feeds me with ease I am a happy camper! They accommodated me with no problem and I had a delicious grilled chicken salad! I was very impressed.My mom was not too keen on her bruschetta wedge salad mainly because of the dressing (which is homemade however I do love their homemade greek dressing!). She still managed to devour most of it though!The staff could have been a little friendlier but they made a meal happen for me so no complaints!
