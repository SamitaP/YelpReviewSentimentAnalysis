The atmosphere was nice. The food was good. Very old school Italian. The signature meatball is well a large meatball. Good yes. The salad was very good and was abundant. The home made pasta was good. We also had a veal dish but was disappointed that it was served with a thick brown gravy over it. Not listed on the menu. Very good drinks and wine list. Although we were seated in the absolute worst table in the place ( in front of kitchen doors) we had a good experience. The food was good but wasn't WOW'ed by any of it.
