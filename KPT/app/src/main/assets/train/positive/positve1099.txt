I am definitely the salt queen.  I literally salt everything from pizza McDonalds French Fries (even though I know that they already have tons of salt on them).  I also salt ham and processed foods.   I always salt food before even tasting it.  Nothing is off limits when it comes to me and my salt shaker.Well when my beautiful meal arrived I asked my server for the salt.  None of the tables had salt or pepper shakers on them.  As my server went to get me the salt shaker I took a bite of my potatoes.  Whoa!!!!!  They were extremely salty!!!!   For the first time in my life  I didn't add any additional salt to my meal.  For me to say something is very salty.... It is very salty. Being the salt queen  I stll  was able to enjoy and love my meal.  I am almost guarantee that the average person would not have enjoyed this food..  My friend also tasted my meal and immediately noticed the heavy taste of salt.  However he never salts anything so something with one grain of salt on it he will be about to tell.  It really suprised me that such an upscaled restaurant would have this much salt added to their food.  I am sure that it was an error or something.  I have eaten here in the past and never experience so much salt.Still my meal for me was delicious.  For the first time in my life I am glad that I did not add any salt to my meal.  I do love Casbah alot.  It is probably my second favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.
