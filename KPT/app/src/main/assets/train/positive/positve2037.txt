This is the second review of The Dor- Stop I gave it another star this time.Canadian Friend of Joe (CFoJ) was getting ready to catch the 4:45 flight to Philly and wanted to share one more meal before leaving the Burgh. He was hungry for breakfast after all it was only noon and he was still in bed. So he calls me and says meet in Dormont for some serious diner food.He's already at a table when I walk in sitting there eating a huge cinnamon roll split in half grilled and looking soooo delicious. So he points to the wall and says Guy from Diners Drive-ins and Dives was here. Spitting pieces of Cinnamon roll at me in his excitement who knew Canada got the food network?I ordered the oatmeal pancakes knowing full well there are eggs in the batter (somethings are just worth having as a vegan) but at least I was smart enough to have the butter on the side so I could discard it later.He ordered the raspberry french toast over hard eggs (Canadian for broken yokes) and bacon a large OJ coffee and the cinnamon bun he was noshing when i entered. The man can eat and he's so thin I really hate him and his metabolism.My oatmeal cakes were HUGE and three to an order I got the first one down without any problem they were moist chewy flavorful with real oatmeal and cinnamon and the syrup was almost not needed as they have a natural sweetness to them.He devoured his french toast eggs bacon saying it was one of the best breakfasts places he's ever been to.It's a shame we take restaurants for granted here's a guy from Vancouver over 3000 miles away wishing the Dor-Stop was in his home town.
