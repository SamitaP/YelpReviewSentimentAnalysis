I don't remember the last time I stepped into a fast food burger joint.  Every time I come here whether it be midday evening or late night there is ALWAYS a wait in the drive thru.  Go at the right time and the person doing the drive thru intercom could be the best entertainment you get in a while.  Oh yeah the food isn't all that bad either props for the fresh cut fries.
