Went here because the Chinese restaurant a couple of doors down from Cain's that we were going to was closed. The noise in this place is over the top so much so that we couldn't have a conversation. We were hungry so we stayed and I'm glad. I got the Cod father 2 with a side of onion rings. This comes served with french fries and coleslaw and hot sauce served on top. I asked if all the stuff be served on the side because I'm picky about coleslaw. This is a great sandwich even deconstructed. The cole slaw is creamy without being soggy and the fries are fresh.The onion rings were stellar. My companion got a rubin and she said that it was pretty good.I was too full but she got a brownie with ice cream and she was very pleased.
