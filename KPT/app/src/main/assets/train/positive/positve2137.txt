One of my favorite breakfast places in the burgh! I have to admit I am one of those food nerds that wants to go to every place that guy from drive ins dinners and dives has been. That is how I discovered this place and I am super glad I did! They are famous for their pancakes and it is clear why that is- their amazing. I've had their banana oatmeal pumpkin and banana pancakes. All amazing and HUGE. Their Italian jumbot was also featured on the show- incredible and spicy which is what I really liked about it. Their hot chocolate is amazing- sooo chocolatey and just the best hot coco around. The service is that of a typical diner so nothing amazing. It's small and not meant for people to stay and chat for hours. Overall I adore the dor stop. Super cute and always delicious. A favorite for sure.
