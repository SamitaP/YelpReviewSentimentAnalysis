I was in Pittsburgh my home town for a recent stay.  Alla Famiglia is the best restaurant I have been to in the Burgh.  It was consistent with the type of upscale dining I have gotten used to in Boston and I was pleasantly surprised.  The area surrounding the restaurant does not seem to be the safest locale but worth going there for a wonderful dinner.  The service was exceptional!  The food was amazing with cheese plates bread and side for the bread basket meatball appetizer cowboy steak with gorgonzola and the halibut.  The tiramisu was the best I have had.  The addition of BYOB was a hidden gem as well.  I would highly recommend this for a special night out to celebrate.  Fantastic restaurant.
