My husbands first time.  Nice to be able to pick your fish and style of cooking.  I had a trio of Jamaican jerk tilapia  salmon  and scallops.  All good but too much sauce on scallops.  Husband had surf n turf special. Snow crab legs tasty but smaller portion than I expected. Glad they had raw oysters  but no idea where they were from.  For $2.50 each you'd think they'd say.  Waitstaff friendly but inexperienced when it came to wine.  We taught two of them how to open a champagne bottle.  Nice time out  but two gripes... #1 Used my phones flashlight to see if there was an outlet on the floor.  Felt like an archaeologist finding old remains of dinners gone by.  Crumbs  napkins wedged between booth and wall  gum  dirt.  For the price I would expect a cleaner place. #2 our waiter kept saying Thank you. After every single sentence  even when it wasn't appropriate.  Silly gripe  right?  But it was way over the top and felt more like  Can I have a tip?  Can I have a tip?
