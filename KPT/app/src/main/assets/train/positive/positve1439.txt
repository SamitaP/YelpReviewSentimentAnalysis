Simply outstanding...we had a large group (11) and everything was perfect. Several comments that this was the best Italian cuisine several of our group had experienced anywhere in the world.  Can't wait to go back!The famous Meatball app did not disappoint (my fav was the stuffed peppers) and the many preparations of veal (main courses) were all exquisite.  Absolutely recommend for any and all who are considering this fantastic establishment!
