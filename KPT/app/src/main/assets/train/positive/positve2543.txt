After 17 years of only being able to choose between three pizza chains I really appreciate little places like this with good pizza.  The pepperoni pizzas are thin and greasy like they're supposed to be the crust is home made the sauce is good and the amount of cheese perfect.It's kind of sad that the other 'V' pizza place around the corner isn't any better than the three national chains.
