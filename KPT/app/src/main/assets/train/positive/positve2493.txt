This is a charming little place overshadowed by D'z Dogs (which is amazing as well) but we're not always in the mood for hot dogs and french fries. Dunnigan's provides an adequate bar with daily specials. The menu is an upgrade from your typical bar/grill. Of course the star item on the menu would have to be the French Onion soup which boasts rich broth soaked up by a thick slice of chewy bread that holds up well and plentiful caramelized onions all smothered by gooey cheese broiled until bubbling to golden perfection. Mmmm.....The restaurant is roomy and comfortable. Perfect for a nice night out with your sweetheart.
