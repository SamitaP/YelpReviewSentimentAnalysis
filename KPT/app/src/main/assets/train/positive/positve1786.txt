As soon as you open the door the smoky aroma of ribs cooking greets you!  The ribs were delish but not as crazy about the sides.  I usually love collard greens and cole slaw with my ribs but the greens were too salty and the cole slaw was nothing special.  Also missing corn bread!  But the ribs are among the best in the Burgh. Only did take out...small place for any large group.
