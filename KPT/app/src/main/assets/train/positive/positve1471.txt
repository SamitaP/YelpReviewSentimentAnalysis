The name is ABC Garden and this is the best Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh.  This place completely satisfies my Chinese food craving when I want that balance between fried deliciousness and fresh ingredients.  The neighborhood is kinda dodgy but since they deliver (and quick i might add) there is no need to tread into Sketchville to pick up the delectable Chinese offerings.   Also there are free extras when you order $20 or more (such as a 2 liter of Pepsi).Update:  Much to my great sadness and disappointment I have had to stop patronizing this establishment due to the extremely rude and unprofessional man they hired to answer the phone.  We tolerated it the first few times even got a laugh out of the fact that he actually dropped the F bomb a few times while taking our order.   But when he became hostile and irate with me on a recent order it was all over.  He started like he always does by laughing at our street name and having me spell it 5 times then interrupted the order without excusing himself to set down the phone and yell at some children I heard in the background then he argued with me about what the menu in my hand said telling me I was wrong and it said something different.  He was aggressive frustrated impatient and clearly has some psychological problems.    I had to make the painful decision to give up this place in spite of the lovely fresh vegetables and tofu cooked to perfection.  :(  I'm trying No. 1 Kitchen on Brownsville instead.
