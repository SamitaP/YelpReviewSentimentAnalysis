I haven't been here in awhile but I definitely miss it. They do hold slightly odd hours as it is a mom and pop joint and they are definitely more of a breakfast place than anything else. Their omelettes are to die for. I'm also a huge fan of their potatoes for breakfast and especially with their gravy. Yum!My boyfriend is more of a burger person but he loves their burgers and fries. They have a few breakfast specials that are just as awesomeIt is very small. And they do not take reservations to my knowledge. If you go on a Sunday morning you will def be waiting for a table.They never used to accept cards but to my knowledge they recently have begun taking credit cards which is a big plus. This is definitely a mom and pop place you need to try.
