I recently walked to the Dor-Stop from my new place in Dormont. I've heard good things including (of course) that they were featured on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives.It was a weekday at around 11am and the place was still packed. I sat at the counter after a brief wait because it was the only available seat in the house. The gentleman next to me as it turns out is related to the restaurant owner. He gets a five-star review but I swear I'm not even taking that into account with my official five-star Yelp rating.The wait staff was very busy but also attentive. Great mix of friendly and efficient. I couldn't decide what to order - everything sounded amazing. I ended up getting banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon. The pancakes were probably the best I've ever tasted. A little crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside. I used ZERO syrup. I prefer my bacon a little crispier but it was still good.I'll be back to sample a more lunch-y entree. In the mean time though five stars for sure!
