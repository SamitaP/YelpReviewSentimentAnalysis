This is me n mumz' second time here for Thanksgiving and they always make us feel like we've come home to family for the holidays.Wonderful service and nice atmosphere for a holiday meal. Speaking of which the food is like homemade too. The smells and football on the TV's makes u feel at home. Free Parking out front; not too shabby!
