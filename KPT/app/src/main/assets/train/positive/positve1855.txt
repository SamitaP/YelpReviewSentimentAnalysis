Ordered General Tso's shrimp Kung Pao chicken soup and egg rolls. Price was slightly higher and portions maybe slightly smaller than similar stores but food quality was certainly in line with food of this type.    The only notable ding I would give is the spicing. Both of our dishes are supposed to have a bit of spice flavor and they are noted on the menu as spicy dishes but there was a notable absence of spice.  There weren't even chilis in the Kung Pao sauce.  It's like someone forgot to spice the dishses.
