I really enjoy Panera and this restaurant meets my expectations. I particularly love the Asiago Cheese Bagel Caesar Salad Bacon Turkey Bravo Sandwich Tuna Salad Sandwich Smokehouse Turkey Panini Broccoli Cheddar Soup and Iced Chai Tea Latte. I've ordered all of these items at this location and they have been very tasty.I have had this location run out of the side of French Baguette once or twice. However last time that occurred I asked for a bread bowl as a replacement which I was given for free.I'll definitely be returning soon!
