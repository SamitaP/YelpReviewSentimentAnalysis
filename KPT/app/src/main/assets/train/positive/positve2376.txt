My husband and I live walking distance to D's and we do love D's... but the place is always so crowded and noisy that I can't give it more than 3 stars.  I can't add much in the way of reviews here as to the food here I think everyone has pretty much hit the nail on the head. The dogs are good and I am happy they have veggie dogs. Beer selection is amazing.It's very family friendly so if that's what you are looking for this is the place for you. Personally I work with children all day  & love them to death don't get me wrong... but I find parents here tend to let their children act out a lot and I find it really distracting and not relaxing. Since I am with children all day I like my meals to not involve yelling and running children. So to solve that problem we just order take out and eat our dogs at home!
