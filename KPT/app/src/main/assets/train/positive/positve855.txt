I've heard about this place I've seen this place and I've wanted to try this place. Finally yesterday my company took us their for lunch and I did not leave disappointed. Don't get me wrong this is not a restaurant that is redefining the culinary scene in the city but it is a tasty place to enjoy your traditional burger fries and drink.The atmosphere is total sports bar but it is not overwhelmingly so. The staff was nice and for being in a party of 14 the server handled us well.The food was great! I got the Salsa Burger subbed with a turkey burger and it was delicious. The burger was plump and large full of flavor and cooked perfectly. I recommend this burger! It also had salsa and guac on top with some cheddar cheese and my mouth is still watering for it. Tip? Get the sweet potato fries!
