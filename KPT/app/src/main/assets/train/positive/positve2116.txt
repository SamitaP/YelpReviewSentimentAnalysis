This place has NEVER disappointed when it comes to the food coming out of their kitchen. The lines occasionally go out the door but the wait is never very long. I have had many different items off the menu as it is a place my girlfriend and I frequent.If you can ever get the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits I would highly recommend and this is coming from a very country boy who was raised on amazing pepper gravy and biscuits. I would be at Dor-Stop all the time if they had the sausage gravy on demand.Note: This is not the norm and the waitress seemed to be having a bad day. The only problem I have ever really had was when one of the waitresses didn't put forth much effort. She never stopped by to fill our drinks. Asked for our order and that was it. Even though we were friendly and polite we never received the same in return. I understand that people have bad days. The waitresses here are very nice but they are human and have their off days. Like I said this was only one time and on a subsequent visit she was much more cheery and friendly. Everyone is human.I would recommend that anyone in the area give this place a try for breakfast and lunch.
