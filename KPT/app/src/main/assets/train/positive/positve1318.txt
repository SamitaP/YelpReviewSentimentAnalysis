It's disappointing that you got lukewarm service Erina.  I've had pretty consistently good vibes (har har--get it?--hippie reference) there from the staff who've been enthusiastic about helping me find what I need.  Hands down this place beats Whole Foods for price and general atmosphere and their salad and hot bar is my go-to when I don't feel like cooking.  Absolutely GREAT bulk section with a wide variety of grains legumes and pastas.  Killer cookies and baked goods.  On the other hand--if I lived on my own I could do all my shopping here.  But since I don't--I can't.  It's tough to stock a household kitchen solely from the EEFC--I mean I can't really afford to regularly buy $15 laundry detergent.  Realistically the Co-op can't serve most of us for one-stop shopping.  But it's worth it to put down a few extra pennies for potatoes or juice to support a genuinely community-oriented business.
