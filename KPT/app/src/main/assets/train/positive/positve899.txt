I ordered 2 pizza's from here today to take to some friends who are volunteering for the election.  Everything was ready in less than 30 mins.  The pizza was good - nothing fancy - not too greasy sauce was good.  I should have ordered the large instead of the medium. I would definitely order from here again.
