Cains had great wings and good service. The Jamaican jerk wings were very crispy as I did request them to be extra well done. The jalepeno cheddar could have been a little more crispy. The sweet potato fries were delicious but they could have been warmer. Service was great overall a great atmosphere and experience and would go back again!
