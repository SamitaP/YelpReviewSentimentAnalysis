First off the food was good but there was a LONG wait and two of our party had to sit on a window sill next to our table. We would go back again if we could get a better table. It was very similar in theme and everything else to Square Cafe in Regent Square. The joint had a larger seating area. Would hit up the Dor-Stop again though.
