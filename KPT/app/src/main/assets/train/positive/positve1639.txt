If this place wasn't up on a hill it might be a hipster paradise. As it stands it is a beloved and well-attended local bar with frequent karaoke nights. I've been there twice and so far the bartender has been the same wonderful slightly hurried lady who remembered us the second time around and who was willing to help me experiment by making a manly cocktail with a raw egg shaken into it. I guess it helps that the other half of Billy's bar is Billy's restaurant with eggs to spare. A good time is always had belting out the classics with friendly faces and free popcorn abounding.  Be forewarned: if you start coming every week some of the classics will become even more classic as you start to realize your new friends have favourite songs to jive to on a regular basis....
