Alla Familgia is to die for. This was described as a MUST have on my trip out East and boy was I glad to stop in as soon as I got off the plane. This is traditional Itaiian at its finest. Hearty sauces fresh meats exquisite flavor. To kick things off- amazing oils a cheese marmalade and HOT bread. The Meatball was excellent. Note I said Meatball as this is one ball bigger than your fist. Stuffed with cheese served in an amazing tomato sauce and topped with fresh parmesan. And this was just the appetizerNext up was the Veal scallopini Tarfuto which is served with onions. But before that arrived first comes an amazing walnut vinagrette salad then a fresh pasta in vodka sauce. Both to die for. Picture the pain I am in before I even get to the veal. Then comes comes the veal. Succulent and melts in your mouth. No knife needed.It goes without say I did finish a single plate but what I did not finish served me well as breakfast the next morning! Round 2!If in the area I would highly recommend stopping by and being transported to a country far far away
