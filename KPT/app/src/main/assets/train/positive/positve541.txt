The service is great and friendly. I got the baked spinach and artichoke dip and it was superb. I love the fresh right out of the oven bread too. I got the Atlantic salmon and it was probably the best fish I have ever tried. Listened to other yelpers suggestion of the shang hai preparation and they were right. Just make sure you make a reservation! Best seafood restaurant in da burgh!
