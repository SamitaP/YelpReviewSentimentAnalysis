I've been coming here regularly for almost 30 years basically since I was born starting back when it was Samurai. Some of the older waitresses (Hide!) are like family at this point so I may be a bit bias. The food is always good the servers are friendly and the chefs are entertaining without being obnoxious like a lot of other hibachi places. I'm not big on sushi but what I've had is good. They have a fantastic selection of wines beers and sake. I'll probably be coming here for another 30 years.
