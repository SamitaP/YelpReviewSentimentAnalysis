Legends...interesting name. With a name like Legends one would assume sports bar but not so much. And I very much liked it that way! Let's roll into a pro/con list...Pros:-Great friendly service. Morgan was my server and she was super fantastic. Quick efficient sweet. She offered up helpful suggestions and even let me try a sample of the soup of the day before I placed my order.-Homemade focaccia: Mmmm rosemary! Tasty and free slivers of love to go with your meal. -Portions: Mammoth. From the bowls of soup to the pastas to the pies...sharing is caring.-Spinach ravioli: My main dish of choice. Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta my friends.Cons:-Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But the value is here though because of the increased portions. -Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd. It's kinda like a diner...with bare tables...and carpet...and a few random pictures on the wall. -No booze beer or wine. It is BYO but I didn't see the corkage fees listed on their menu.Overall a solid place for homecooked Italian eats. I would sprint back to Legends just for that ravioli! Mangia!
