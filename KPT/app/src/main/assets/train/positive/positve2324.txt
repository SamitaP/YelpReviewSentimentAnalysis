Living 2 blocks from this place is dangerous.  If you're into quality beer and good pub grub then this is your place.  My favorites are the pizza chicago style hot dogs and cheese fries!  When it comes to the beer let's just say that there are more selections than you can imagine (... they claim 1000+!!!)
