DRINKS: Water for me Yuengling for my fianceAPPETIZERS: Cup of Maine Lobster Bisque for me -- soo good! My fiance had the New Orleans Seafood Gumbo which I had a taste of it and it was good but I liked my soup better...very rich and creamy but full of flavor with a fair amount of lobster bits mixed in. The bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (I believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. Our entrees came with house salads - had great elements but I felt I couldn't enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and I can't handle too much acidity in my food these days. My fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence I utter often).ENTREES: I had one of the specials Grilled Shrimp and Scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which I asked for on the side). The seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. My fiance had the special of Cod stuffed with Lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - I had a taste of his and it was really yummy I'll def order that next time! We both finished our plates which wasn't too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (I got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling.DESSERT: Didn't order anySERVICE: Friendly though a little sparse. After we finished our meals we felt like we were waiting around for awhile before we could ask for our check. But our server was overall friendly and we didn't feel neglected or anything.DEALS/DISCOUNTS: NoneOVERALL: We liked the variety and freshness of seafood. Def a place we'd consider going to again which is the main mark of a very good experience!
