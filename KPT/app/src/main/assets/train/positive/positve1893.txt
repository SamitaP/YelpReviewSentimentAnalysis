I love Beto's! Having said that I acknowledge that their style of pizza is not for everybody. Do you love cheese? Do you love it so much that you want it so thick that it doesn't melt? I do! The sauce has chunks of tomato in it and the crust is thin and square cut. It tastes like no other pizza but if you grew up eating it nothing else is as good!
