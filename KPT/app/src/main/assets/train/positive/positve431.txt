While visiting relatives in Somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of Homestead.  My aunt insisted that we have lunch at Uno's Pizzeria & Grill as the food was delicious.  When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  My aunt was right you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill it is FANTASTIC!!
