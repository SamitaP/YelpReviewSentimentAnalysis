Delicious pizza. Amazing beer selection. We don't live anywhere close to this place and will drive 45+ minutes for their food and ambience. Whenever I have family visiting and we have the time we trek over for a delicious dinner at Bado's. Be sure to check out their chalkboard with the drink and food specials!We've never had any problems with the service or the food and will definitely be back!
