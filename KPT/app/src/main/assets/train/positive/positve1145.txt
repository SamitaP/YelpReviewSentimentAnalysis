A cool (if mildly painfully hipster-ish) decor; perfect settingfora Sunday brunch. The service was great the food was both satisfying and healthy and the milkshake I had to top off my omelet was deeeeelicious. Are all of their milkshakes vegan? Because ifthey are I was completely fooled. A little more than I was hoping to pay for a breakfast dish but I suppose I can't complain as it was morethan enough to hold me through until dinner. (I agree with the comment I saw that stated that this would be a perfect place for a hungover posse!)
