My wife and I have been here a number of times and it's gotten better each time. Some tips:- stick with the appetizers. Every one we've had is fantastic. The entrees are fine but nothing special. The apps on the other hand are truly first rate.- eat as much of their bread as your stomach will let you. Holy crap it's good!- It's BYO so make sure to bring your favorite bottle of wine.- On a nice day inside but by the big window/door to the left. It let's in a nice breeze and makes the meal fantastic.Try this place you won't regret it.
