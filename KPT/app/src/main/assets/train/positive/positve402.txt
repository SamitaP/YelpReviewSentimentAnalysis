If I were to describe this place in one sentence I would call it a mediocre and cheaper version of Bettis 36 on the North Shore.My wife and I won a gift card in a raffle.  We went for lunch on a Saturday. It was not crowdedWe entered the restaurant and were promptly seated by a nice server.  The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and did not feel run down or old in any way.Our server took our drink order and returned promptly.  We got the pretzels with beer cheese appetizer and we each got a hamburger.Our food arrived promptly and the appetizer was fine.  10 years ago I would have called it good or better but time has marched on and expectations are higher then they once were.The same goes for the main course. The fries were unremarkable but decent as were both burgers.  The bill was also fair.  The meal with two drinks and an appetizer was reasonable for what we got. The server was pleasant and attentive. All in all this Fridays as a good but likely quickly forgotten experience.I would return here for lunch like I did today.
