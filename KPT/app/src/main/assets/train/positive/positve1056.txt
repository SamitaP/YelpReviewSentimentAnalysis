Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. The calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there but maybe they do! The pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal. I like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static but since they use a lot of local ingredients the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon.
