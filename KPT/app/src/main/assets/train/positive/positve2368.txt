I am not huge on hot dogs or beer. However I am huge on add-ons. This is where D's comes in. I totally recommend the chihuahua hot dog. It has avocado!!! The wings are delish too. This place is a must go for beer lovers. I am still the light and sweet kinda beer person so I tried something with raspberry notes in it and LOVED it! Oh and the fries are awe-frickin-some!! My second fave in the city after Point Brugge.
