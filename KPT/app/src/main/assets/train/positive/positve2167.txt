This is a staple breakfast place for my family. My husband went to Pitt and frequented with his friends. If you are going for some eggs and bacon... Don't waste your time. In my opinion the best eggs bacon and toast you'll ever find is in your own kitchen. With that being said the hot cakes are a great go to. BUT my alllll time favorite is the eggs benedict. They use thick Texas toast and ham cut off the bone. I'm from MI and grew up on Honey Baked Ham so trust me when I say dor stop has some good ham. If you're having a sweet tooth kinda day you have to have the raspberry french toast. Very sweet though.I have a friend who literally can't not get the south of the border omelette never had it but every time he orders it I think about how good it looks hahaOnly negative I have to say is with the kids menu. My daughter loves fruit... The only pancakes they offer are chocolate chip or plain. Now of course she would gladly take the chocolate (but me being mom say no with breakfast) they will not add bananas to the pancakes. You have to order the regular menu size if you want your child to have fruit in their pancakes. Also... Don't get the sausage always go for the bacon.Don't get scared off by all the people waiting too. The girls working the register and seating are awesome with making sure the place moves smoothly!
