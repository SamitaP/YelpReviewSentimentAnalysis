One of the few reasons I may miss Pittsburgh when I go to grad school. The hot dogs are piled on high with the best fattiest stuff I can muster up and the beer selection is one of the best in Allegheny Co. Great for a night out with friends followed by indie movies at the Regent Square Theatre across the street.
