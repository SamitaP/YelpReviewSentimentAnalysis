Spent the weekend in the city with some friends. This was our first time to Alla Famiglia.  Unbelievable!!!  We enjoyed everything.  If you are looking for high quality food with a great friendly staff this is it.  It is a little out of the way but it is worth the trip.  If I had the option to give 6 stars I would do it.   Very impressive.
