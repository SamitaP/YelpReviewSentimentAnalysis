D's looks unassuming but it's really over the top. Sure they have fries but why not order fries with bacon and cheese on them plus ranch dressing on the side (You should by the way - those are the pub fries and they are delicious). You could order a plain hot dog but why do that when you have a choice of five different kinds of frank and toppings like the Chihuahua: avocado salsa cheese and jalapeno? Plus your dog (even if it's a turkey dog like mine) might arrive at the table with a little char on it; that to me is the peak of hot dog flavor.I feel like a restaurant that serves cheese sauce like a food group should have a warning label on the door but with their sense of humor the label would say Warning: the food inside is damn delicious and best consumed with a great beer.
