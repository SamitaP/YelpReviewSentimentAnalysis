Do you know Max & Erma's? Well say hello to just Max (no seriously Erma sold out.)Max's specializes in delicious German fare (think Hofbrauhaus only better) and a delightful atmosphere. This is the type of restaurant that after you go once you just want to go back again and again. You'll be in the middle of finals and think sampler platter please. If you're going out in the North Side to catch a game or out to a museum I highly recommend stopping by Max's to partake in a meal. I have yet to be let down.
