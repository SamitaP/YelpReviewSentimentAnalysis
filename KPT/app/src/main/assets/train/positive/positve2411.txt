Was in town for a recent sporting event and read good things about Ds. A bit off the beaten path but an easy bus ride from my Oakland hotel (and bus originates from Downtown so should be easy ride from there too).Ds did not disappoint: creative craft beer list of 25+ taps plus hundreds of bottles in the Beer Cave that you can have onsite or take to-go and some of the best dogs I've ever had. Was there on a Friday so got the Scorpion (cheddar jalapeno kielbasi) & fries deal for $5.50--excellent. Also tried the very good Ds Brat (cheesy bratwurst) & fries (same price) and they do a terrific version of the Chicago Dog. There are also 20+ toppings options if you want to DIY. Nice friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.Next time I'm in PGH Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).P.S. There is also sit-down service in a room between the bar and Cave that seemed more family-friendly. I noticed several tables had pizzas and burgers so I assume those are decent too.
