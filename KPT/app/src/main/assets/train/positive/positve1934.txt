We only moved to Pittsburgh last year so we are far from locals but it only took one visit for us to become devotees of Beto's.I understand the polarizing nature of a Beto's style pizza but we definitely have established ourselves at the far THUMBS UP end of the spectrum.By not cooking the pizza with the toppings it preserves the fantastic crust by not allowing the oil from melted cheese to make it soft and gooey.  Instead the crust remains fresh firm and flavorful.  They sauce is deliciously fresh and tangy with lots of nice chunks of tomato.  And the toppings we get either just cheese or cheese/pepperoni and generous and delicious.It may take a little getting used to and you may have to wait because of its popularity but Beto's is worth it.  As someone who has enjoyed NYC and Chicago style pizzas at their best Beto's has redefined great pizza for my family and me.Enjoy!
