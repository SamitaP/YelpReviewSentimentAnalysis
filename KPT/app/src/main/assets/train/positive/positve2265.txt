BRAVO! We just had our first Bado's experience and it most definitely won't be our last. This place doesn't get enough credit. Being new to the Mt. Lebo area I've heard so many things about Beto's. We've tried there and while it wasn't bad I just didn't see what the hype was about. I was way more impressed with Bado's! Their pizza was awesome!! Their beer selection is pretty extensive as well especially for the size of the place. The food came out quickly even though there wasn't an open seat in the whole place bar included. Overall great experience food and restaurant. I'm so glad it's a local joint. I love giving kudos to places like Bado's that truly deserve it!
