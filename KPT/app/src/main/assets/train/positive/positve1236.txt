Food was great--- vegetarian burrito stuffed with mac and cheese???? yes please.  Also had a great pot of tea and a bangin' white chocolate hazelnut banana milkshake.  It's a really cute place too.however the owner was seriously rude to me and my fellow guests when we asked to split a check (which they state on the menu is allowed).  Not even passive aggressive- straight up aggressive for something that was not our fault.  so that was a sour end to my experience at Quiet Storm. but my belly was satisfied.
