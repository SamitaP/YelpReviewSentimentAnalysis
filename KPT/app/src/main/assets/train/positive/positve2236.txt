Whenever I'm in Bado's I'm reminded of Nemo's the fictional pizza joint from Everybody Loves Raymond. My first expierence with this place was two years ago I had spent the entire day in the waiting room of St. Clair Hospital with my mother who was admitted finally at 8pm she was fine and released a few days later. But at 8pm I was ready to eat anything and Bado's was on the way home. So I parked and walked I'm and the place was packed. Good sign. So a seat at the bar opened and the Pens were playing. So I ordered a bottled IPA and read over the menu. I needed to power carb after a long day of sitting in a hospital waiting room. The bartender who doubled as a pizza chef told me the white pizza was exceptional so I took his advice and ordered a medium figuring I could have it for lunch the next day. What arrived was this wonderfully thick cheesy reeking of garlic in a good way just what I needed comfort food that instantly made the days worries seem distant. The first bite was heaven chewy center crisp bottom olive oil coating my mouth ooey gooey italian cheeses saltiness from the black olives I ordered as a topping. This was pizza! Two slices and I was full I drank my beer and paid the bill and walked out with lunch and dinner for the next day. I must return here someday and have the same pie.
