I really liked this food. I'm not Indian but my boyfriend is. He liked it too! We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered from the menu instead of the buffet. We ordered the chili chicken chicken 65 lamb biryani Lamb vindaloo and tadka dal. It was delicious. The chicken 65 wasn't spicy or flavorful enough but everything else was incredible. We spiced everything at. 7/10. It had a bite but wasn't too hot. Erythema was freshly made. There were only two other families in the restaurant when we were there both Indian/Pakistani? Service was slow and grumpy. But it was totally worth it. It's hard to find good Indian food in Pittsburgh. Udipi is ok for pure veg... Corriander is greasy... India gardens dishes all taste the same... I would return. Portions were small but I like that because then you can order more things to taste! Although prices were relatively high. Every entree was about $12 and were ordered 4. It was worth it regardless.
