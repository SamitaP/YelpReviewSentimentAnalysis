This was an amazing brunch place! A family friend asked me grab brunch here because her son used to work here as a chef/cook. The food was divine! The brunch comes with a cocktail an appetizer  and then your meal. The coffee was really good and the mimosas were strong. We sat outside on the patio and it was just beautiful. A perfect retreat from the snowy outside that morning. Definitely go!
