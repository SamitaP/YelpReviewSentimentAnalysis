Gotta say....worth the effort to find this gem of a restaurant off the beaten path. First the waitstaff at this place are incredible. They take everything in stride. Things start with fresh bread a small dish of olives and the Holy oil....better love garlic!Appetizer....a tasty softball-sized meatball with mozzarella in a nicely spiced red sauce. Not your average hamburger meatball...this is a work of art...perfectly seasoned juicy and delicious.Salad....wow! Crisp greens olives peppers Gorgonzola with a red wine based vinaigrette...couldn't stop eating it.Pasta course....opted for both house pastas....the first was the oft mentioned linguine tossed in the wheel of Romano with cream and black pepper. Served table side with a bottle of deliciously spicy oil. Second was the curly pasta tossed in the signature vodka sauce! The pasta was spot on cooked...not a soggy noodle in sight. The preparations were executed to perfection.Entrees...veal Milanese...this is a beautiful double chop paddled into tenderness dredged in house made bread crumbs tossed with pine nuts and cooked to perfection. If you can only order one thing here...this is it! We also had the filet of beef in Gorgonzola cream...medium rare tender well seasoned...rich decadent and incredible.Dessert....yes...we forced ourselves...homemade cannoli and a variant of tiramisu with toasted/burnt almond slivers and raspberries. Tiramisu was delectable...light balanced and very flavorful.Haven't really added much to the raves from previous patrons...just had to chime in our hearty AMEN of agreement. Love everything about this place. Thank you Jonathan...and all of your staff for an awesome dining experience.
