the battleship. 26 of good bun fresh meats tons of lettuce and tomato all for 11 bucks?  ill admit driving through and parking on the streets of swissvale brought me closer to God since i said a prayer that my car was going to start.  i saw the place was held up a month after we were there but that could happen anywhere. good sub i omitted salt and pepper and oragano bc it just doesnt seem right on a cold sub. they have hot subs too maybe take my chances and go there for a cheesesteak
