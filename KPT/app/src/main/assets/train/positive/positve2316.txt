I came here with a bunch of Russian language students who go to the University of Pittsburgh figuring locals and Russian speakers would know the best bars.  I was not wrong.This place is absolutely awesome with an impressive beer selection and great prices.  The staff is spot on with suggestions and somehow able to keep up with about 100 simultaneous and separate tabs going at once.  At happy hour I had incredible Belgian wheat beer for about $3 and even the pizza wasn't bad.  For the upscale beer they serve the place isn't trendy or yuppie.  You go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever they have on draft (it changes often).  They even let you make your own six packs and walk off with them. The music is good and not played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers.  Highest endorsement.To Rob ogromnoye spaceba!
