This is a popular place so usually skip it due to a short wait list...just don't want to wait  for pizza and so many pizza shops in the area.  No wait on this Friday night.  Bado's has  all that you need..a good beer selection neat atmosphere and more than pizza..pub grub lots of options here.  The wait staff was good and on the ball.  But the pizza is what most people talk about so we ordered Bado's  Famous Pizza   (the traditional Our most popular crust) and the hot wings.  It did not take long and the pizza and wings came out.  The wings were hotter than most places and pretty good.  The pizza crust was a little thicker and nice flavor and chewy good though I tend to prefer thinner crust.  All in all a nice place good beer good service and food.
