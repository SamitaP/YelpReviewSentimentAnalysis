I lived in Pittsburgh for four years and have never been to D's but I visited recently and went with some friends. What lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers and I was not let down. I got two hot dogs--a Chicago and a mac and cheese. Really really good. My boyfriend ordered the Red Alert dog (his was meat) and his face basically melted off but he insisted he loved it. Then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts but to each his own. He had a great time. My two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it. The beer cave is awesome. I'd love to give D's five stars but like a couple of people mentioned the service is lacking. Everyone is friendly but I had to walk around and find our server so I could pay and then find him again when he didn't return. It took us a while to get water refills too. The dining area and the bar are separated and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though.
