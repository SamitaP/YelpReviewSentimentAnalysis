SoHo is always a great place to start out at before heading to a Pirates game or anything else going on in the North Shore. My networking group had a social here a couple of weeks ago - and it went awesome! We provided appetizers for the group - and they ended up bringing more than what we had ordered as a thank you. Also we had almost 100 people They sectioned off part of the bar for our group and were able to accommodate everyone with their drink orders in a quick fashion. They are SUPER easy to work with and we are looking to hold more repeat events here because of that.
