I had always meant to visit Enrico's and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my list.So here's what I liked: the cappuccino was perfect. It's an awesome cappuccino topped with a cute foam art leaf.Here's what I didn't like: Sometimes I take my cappuccino plain sometimes I take it with a shot of syrup. On this occassion I asked if I could get amaretto syrup which they had. But the barista responded: No you can't. He said they only make their cappuccino plain and if I liked sweet he could make me something special but I would have to trust his taste. Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.I'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a REAL cappuccino tasted like. Please I lived in Italy I've had a REAL cappuccino...but right now I want a flavor shot in it. I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place and he did offer to make me something different. I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not allowed to add them to your drink? It's a 5-star cappuccino for sure but I had to subtract a star for the attitude.
