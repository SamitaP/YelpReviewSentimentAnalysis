One of my weekly lunch or breakfast place.Good home cooked food and reasonable prices. I would avoid busy times. An Sunday mornings. The staff is limited and cannot handle the full crowd. I never have a problem usually except today my glass of milk was chunky( turned sour ).Sadly Shirley has passed on and will be missed.
