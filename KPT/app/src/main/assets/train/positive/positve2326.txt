First stop on my Midwest Brew Crawl with the BF! The BF ate here once last year and loved it so much that we decided that we needed to make it our first stop on our road trip to Minnesota. We planned our departure time so that we could get here at lunch (it was a mere 7 hour drive!) We both ordered the Bacon Cheese all beef dog (hot dog with bacon and melted cheddar on top) plus a corn dog dusted wings and two root beers. We didn't try any of the beers on tap since we still had a lot of driving ahead of us. The Bacon Cheese was ridiculously good and I wished that I could have finished it. Unfortunately I hogged pretty much all of the corn dog since it was AMAZING!!!  The wings were also really good maybe even among the top three chicken wings that we had the whole trip.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the Pittsburgh area or anyone who is crazy enough to drive 7 hours for a hot dog.
