After further investigation I opt for the butcher boy. Fried jumbo. Jumbo? Jumbo what? Seems its a local delicacy you can only get in Pittsburgh - just kidding. I don't even like bologna but I actually drool thinking about this sandwich. Heck I would practically be a vegetarian if I stopped eating here but its so worth it now and then.
