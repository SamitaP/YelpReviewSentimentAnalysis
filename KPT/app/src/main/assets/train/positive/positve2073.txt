WOW. When you read best pancakes ever believe it. My boyfriend and I were on our way from Milwaukee WI to Easton PA and figured we should find some good food along the way and The Dor-Stop fit the bill - we'd be arriving near Pittsburgh at just the right time for breakfast. This place was bustling - we got there at about 8:30am on a Saturday but we only had to wait a few minutes. Our waitress was sweet and courteous and she told us about the popular items on the menu because we'd told her it was our first time there. He and I both got the Eggs Combo - two eggs choice of meat (bacon sausage or ham off the bone). He got banana pancakes and bacon and I got pumpkin pancakes with the ham. The ham was wonderful - albeit a little salty (but all ham tastes salty to me) but by the time I finished my perfect over-medium eggs and one of my pancakes I was pretty full so I wasn't able to finish the ham. That didn't stop me from sneaking a couple of bites of my boyfriend's banana pancakes though! If I ever find myself driving east again I will be sure to take the detour out to the Dor-Stop. I will be dreaming about the pumpkin pancakes until I can manage to somehow make something half as good. Absolutely amazing! Best. Pancakes. Ever.
