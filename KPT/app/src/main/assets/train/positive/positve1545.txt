I have a friend that loves this place and I have been told it's the best German food in Pittsburgh so I had to give it a try.I had the Roasted Loin of Pork Stubenkuchen Style with German Style Potato Salad and Sauerkraut. Everything was really good. The Pork was delicious and that mushroom gravy that they put on it was nothing short of amazing. I want a whole bucket of the stuff to put on everything. The Sauerkraut was interesting featuring shredded pork mixed in. The german potato salad was good but was pretty much what I expected. Their draft  beer Selection left a little bit to be desired but featured 5-8 beers many of them popular german style beers. I got a good idea what this place is all about and I have to say that I will be back for more.
