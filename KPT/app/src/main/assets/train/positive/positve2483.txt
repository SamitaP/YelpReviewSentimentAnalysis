Great fries.  Lots of bar food -- burgers six packs dogs...etc.  The restaurant is small and got VERY crowded.  A few tables and wooden chairs and a couple of high top tables by a garage door that I imagine opened when it is not frigid cold out like tonight.  It is like a beer bar without a bar.Several beers on tap...I imagine that is the reason for the crowd because it certainly isn't the food.  The food is greasy Pittsburgh fare that doesn't seem really all that great.  Granted I loved the fries.  But would I wait for 30 minutes for a table for really unhealthy generally unimpressive food?  Nope.  Fortunately we had just beaten the crowds or I would not be writing this review.   After we were seated people poured in.  Families with little kids and groups of older adults standing in the crowded doorway waiting for the opportunity to eat mediocre food.  Hmmm....makes me think a new restaurant in Regent Square is in order because there is clearly a deficit.
