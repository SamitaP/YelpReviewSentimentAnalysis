AMAZING!  I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally made it.  Ever since I saw it featured on the Food Network I've been wanting to go.We went for breakfast and I ordered the stuffed raspberry french toast.  I ended up getting the cherry though...  I took a bite and while it was good I really wanted the raspberry.  I let them know and they quickly replaced my order with what I wanted and took it totally off the bill because they felt bad I had to wait longer for my food.  That was really unexpected and really nice!Once I tried the raspberry stuffed french toast I loved it really really good.  There are so many other things on the menu that I would love to try as well such as the banana chocolate chip pancakes the breakfast burrito ect.I would certainly go back to this place and hope that I do the next time I am in the Pittsburgh area.  So so good.
