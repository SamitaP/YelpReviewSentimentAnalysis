I can remember the time when I used to strictly drink mocha frappuccinos from Starbuck's thinking that it was the be all end all to coffee in my younger teens. Don't we all miss those days of being so naive? Admittedly I never finish any coffee that I drink not only because I'm apparently wasteful now that I think about it but also because I'm a slow sipper and everything settles at the very end. Make no mistakes I will finish any coffee drink from Tazza D'oro and at record speed. It is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is they don't think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee -- it's ready for drinking the moment you receive your order. Let's not forget about the food which is also delicious. it's clear I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.Some of the staff remembers your order to a tee and all of them are always very courteous. The prices are reasonable and the location is great tucked away in Highland Park.
