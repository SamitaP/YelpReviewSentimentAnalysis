Mitchell's is located on the river side of the Waterfront and out of the crazy let's fight to find a parking spot area.  They do take reservations but doubtful you need one on a weekday during lunch.  It wasn't busy when I was there on a Tuesday at noon.Mitchell's has a cool layout - large full bar in the middle private large rooms for large parties smaller areas for business lunches full dining room seating with tables and booths and an excellent outdoor patio where you can watch people ride by on the bike trail.  This is a seafood restaurant with lots of good options for fresh in season fish.  You can choose from a number of different fish to have prepared for salads sandwiches or just as they are.  I had the chopped salad and added scallops to it.  Delicious!  The price range is reasonable and you can plan on spending around $15 with your lunch and a soda/iced tea.  For that price you really can't complain.  I drop almost that much at Panera on a half sandwich and cup of soup with an iced tea.  I'm sure it's much busier for dinner but I find Mitchell's to be an excellent place for a business lunch or just meeting friends.  I've been here for brunch as well and had an excellent Bloody Mary and eggs benedict with crab.
