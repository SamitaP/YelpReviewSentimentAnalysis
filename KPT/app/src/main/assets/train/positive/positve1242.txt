Great atmosphere lots of owl decorations.  The staff are very nice and are really trendy. It looks like they are working hard. I experienced fast service even though the cafe was almost full. Temperature was nice and the noise was average they have some good window tables. I would say there is a good mix of regular neighborhood locals here hipsters and intellectual types. The demographic also includes college students. It's all Vegetarian or vegan yay!  The food is normally very good.  I did have one experience where in terms of how spicy I wanted my meal I replied 0 out of 10.  The food came and my dish was probably an 8 out of 10 in terms of spicy-ness.  I could barely eat it as could others at my table.  Eventually I gave up trying to finish it.  I could have asked for a replacement but I chose not to but Im certain they would of fixed it for me if I had.  But other than this instant I've found the food fresh and well cooked.
