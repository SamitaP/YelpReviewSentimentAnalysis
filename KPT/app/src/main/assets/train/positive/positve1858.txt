I've been a Tom's Diner fan for almost 20 years and it's not like it used to be. Classic diner fare with the diner look of retro booths and counter area. The one major thing that seems to have changed is the consistency of the food. Some days the gyro is fully loaded and some days a pb&j would've worked better. Home fries are a hit or miss breakfast item and the omeletes are good but have been better. Overall Tom's is a better pick than Eat N Park up the street but it won't take long to grow weary of the selections. The service has always been great I just wish they'd bring back more of the Greek type specialties.
