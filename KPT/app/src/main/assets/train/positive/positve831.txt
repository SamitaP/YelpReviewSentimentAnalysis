I walked in to this business and immediately knew I could risk a latte without flavoring to cover up poor quality or technique and I was absolutely correct. The espresso was a perfect balance of flavor with a smooth finish the foam was stretched perfectly and expertly poured to form a heart in my mug. My accomplice's Americano was equally well made not a note of sourness but plenty of body and flavor. I regret that I didn't notice the Manual bar menu before I ordered I've been dying to try a pour-over coffee and I know it would have been delicious. Pro-Tip: There is no sign for the unisex restroom which is to the left of the service area past the bulletin corkboard.
