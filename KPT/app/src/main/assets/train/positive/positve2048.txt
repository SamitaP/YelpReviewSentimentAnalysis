What an awesome spot for brunch. Though we don't live too far away the traffic was horrendous and all we could think about was some yummy food to shovel into our mouths. Even though the place was packed we were luckily seated right away and presented with menu eery person wants to see on a Saturday morning. we all ordered what we wanted and didn't have to wait too long! Best part is everything is made from scratch and you can def tell. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at a decent price and we will for sure be back.
