It would get 4 stars for the name alone.  The idea that they would just sell you hot dogs and six-packs is so just and pure it almost makes me want to weep.  I went here and had the bacon chili cheddar dog and one with relish kraut and brown mustard.  Both were excellent dogs and their beer list is incredible.  Again how come we can't have this is Boston where it comes off as real?  If they tried this in NYC or Boston it would come off as a gimmick.  Whereas here in Swissvale it just seems like a neighborhood place with a twist.  A coronary twist.  So good.....
