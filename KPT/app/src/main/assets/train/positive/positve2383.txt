It was either Mother Theresa or the Baha Men who said Who let the dogs out? and I must say I was glad someone let my bacon cheddar dog out of the kitchen and into my stomach.  Dee-licious!Stopped in here before seeing a movie at the Regent Square Theater for some beers dogs and chili cheese fries.  I had two IPAs that were good and reasonably priced.  I couldn't finish the fries so I took them with me to the movie theater and the lady didn't mind that I brought them in.  I finished them fairly quickly once the movie started (I was seeing the Swedish version of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so this was a while ago.)Also since I was just visiting town I didn't have a car and I rode the bus there all the way by myself!So the point is you can eat here and get a great dog and good beer and you can also take the bus here and then see a movie.
