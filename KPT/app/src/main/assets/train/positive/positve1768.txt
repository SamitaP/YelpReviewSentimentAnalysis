Okay hold the phone I wouldn't call Pickles an Emporium.I haven't actually eaten their sandwiches what I typically order is the bacon cheddar fries which are pretty damn tasty for a pizza shop.  Anyway on the bacon Cheddar fries there is tons of melted cheese and real bacon!!!  Oh yeah  a total guilty pleasure. Anyway I was raised eating at Pickles. This was our go to pizza place at home but not due to quality but more do their willingness to deliver to our house.  In the neighborhoods I live in the pizza man don't deliver around here anymore.  For some tasty fries I would highly recommend Pickles for anything else I would suggest going else where.
