In need of healthy goodness today! Parked right out front. There were a decent amount of patrons but nothing that would make me growl at the person standing in front of the Thai coconut soup I so desperately wanted. First thing I did was order a wheat grass shot and my favorite juice bar drink...Dante's Inferno! It is a bright red drink that contains organic beets carrot celery ginger and garlic. I never get it with garlic even though you should. I can't handle that much garlic in a drink. I'm a wuss. Hot foods was bumpin' but I was still able to stroll around and decide on what Indian Kitchen cookery would go in the belly for dinner. A little tofu surprise chickpea curry steamed kale steamed veggies with big slices of zucchini and a few red lentil scoops. Everything looked fresh and delicious. After grabbing 2 soups and my dinner I downed my sweet wheat grass shot and was ready to get home. At the register they forgot to ring up the shot but I had to let them know. All smiles as I left. Don't forget to tip the juice bar peeps.
