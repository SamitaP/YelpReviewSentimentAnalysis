When I entered I was ready to wow-ed. It was my kind of place -- BYO shabby-chic decor intimate setting condensed menu and a waitress with an accent. But our food didn't live up to my expectations. The Portuguese bread served before our meal was crusty warm and special -- a cross between a French loaf and cornbread. Unfortunately things went down hill from here. The highly recommended goat cheese and phyllo dough tart was too rich and too mild The pears didn't give enough sweetness and there wasn't any salt. So it was just creamy. Plain and creamy.  Between us we had three entrees. The salmon was my favorite of the three. It was an interesting preparation and well done. But nothing special. The monk fish special was too sweet for my taste and a bit tough. (I don't want to have to use a knife to cut my fish.) I appreciated the homemade pasta and delicate flavors of the ravioli but it was just too bland. A bit of salt or spicy or something would have been nice. I may come back to try the burger but no more $25 disappointing entrees for me.
