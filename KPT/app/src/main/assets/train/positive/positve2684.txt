I've come here for German Language meetups and their soups are always delicious. Last Saturday I had Chicken and Wild Rice in a bread bowl which was very good and filling which was perfect since I missed breakfast. I also recall sometime ago I had one of their chocolate chip cookies that was excellent. The establishment is clean and well laid-out. They always seem to have a nice selection of soups salads and desserts. I've never seen it get too crowded which allows for good conversation without any need to shout. I am a satisfied repeat customer.
