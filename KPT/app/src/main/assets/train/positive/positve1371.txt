Cafe Zinho is a quaint little spot tucked away in the hidden corners of Shadyside.I have driven by it many times without even realizing it was a restaurant. Thankfully my more knowledgeable girlfriend recommended checking it out as she had to buy me dinner. Cruel world I know.We were able to get an early reservation on a Saturday pick up a bottle of wine ( a must!) and make it relatively on time. Intimate is precisely the word I would use to describe this living room dining experience. The waitresses are what you would want your host mom to be like from a foreign country and splendidly cheery.We ordered two apps both delicious. They also served some impeccable cornbread as well. The first app was a pastry sort of thing covered in goat cheese that was worthy of plate licking had it been socially acceptable. The second was a batch of clams in a fragrant tomato sauce (the sauce also went well on the goat cheese pastry). Most of the time when I order clams they are far too fishy but these were perfect.The lady friend ordered the special a quail dish while I ordered lamb osobuco. The portions were very generous and you could easily see the care and prep that went into each individual dish. I must say the quail was divine. I ended up super jealous and contemplated tricking the gf to turn around so I could switch plates while she was distracted. It was a mixture of sweet and layered with spices the meat juicy and rich. The lamb was textured and cooked very well however it seemed to lack a distinctive flavor to bring out the qualities of the meat itself. Perhaps more garlic or such.Either way I will return maybe with some Portuguese phrases in hand to banter with my adopted foreign mom/waitress.
