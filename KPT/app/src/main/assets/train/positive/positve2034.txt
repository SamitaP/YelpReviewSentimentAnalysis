I had no idea that this restaurant was legendary when I decided to eat there this morning with my family.  I was severely hungover and just needed some grease and the concierge at my mother's hotel happened to recommend this place.The restaurant is cozy (read: small) and situated in a really quaint neighborhood at the top of a massive (and somewhat scary) hill. The restaurant itself was buzzing and had a great neighborhood vibe. Despite it being *packed* we were seated right away.The menu wasn't too fussy but there were a lot of options. I ordered the dor-stop burger (burger with sauteed onions and green peppers american cheese and two slices of texas toast) and fries. My husband got the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings and we split our meals. The food was simple enough but amazingly delicious. I think they battered the onion rings in crack. I also ordered an orange juice which I could tell was fresh squeezed.The portion sizes were reasonable too! Not gigantic which I appreciate. I finished my meal feeling like a brand new woman. I think I'll look for reasons to come to Pittsburgh now that I know this restaurant exists. Yum.
