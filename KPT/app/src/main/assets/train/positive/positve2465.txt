D's is always worth the trip whether you're stopping by for some food or heading straight to the beer cave to build your own six pack. Maybe it attracts a certain kind of younger crowd but it is truly a no-frills kind of place and the people working there could not be more friendly and accommodating. The first time I came here our server was super chill and chatty with us as well as patient while we took our time figuring out how many add-ons to pile on top of our food despite the busy atmosphere of the place.The food is cheap and hits the spot for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. I will say their seitan wings were particularly crunchy/dry and not altogether satisfying shared between people but the flavors were great.But let's be real you're probably coming here for the dogs. It's cool I do too. And you will probably want to add avocado to whatever it is you're getting because avocado is for winners just like the ocean.One night during some seriously biblical amounts of rain and lightning the power went out temporarily and workers and patrons alike kept on going like it was -no big deal- demonstrating that the strength of D's can weather any storm.
