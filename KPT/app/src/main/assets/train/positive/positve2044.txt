I just love this place.  My grandma lives just a few minutes away so it is has recently become one of our stops when we come visit her. The environment of the place is perfect: friendly happy and serving great food.  I even found the coffee here delicious.  I got the special for the day which was the Irish Jumbot.  My grandma explained to me this morning that jumbot when referring to food mean just a plate full of different kinds of things.  That is exactly what it was.  The reason this was an Irish jumbot was because it had corned beef in it.  Oh my it was delicious.In the past my mother has ordered the flavored french toast with the blueberries.  I still remember it being one of the most different and delicious breakfast plates I have ever had.  I will defiantly be back to the Dor-Stop soon.  It is honestly one of the best breakfast places I have been to in the area.
