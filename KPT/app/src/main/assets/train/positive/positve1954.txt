Me and E n' P go waaaaay back!  Our relationship started at 16 years old.  It was my first job and continued to supplement my burgeoning shopping addiction throughout High School and into College.  I had a fantastic time throwing people's menus down as a hostess and then filling food orders (and occasionally spilling orange juice on people's crotches oops) as a waitress and gossiping with my coworkers.  So needless to say I have a special place in my heart for this lovely establishment!I think for a Pittsburgh owned chain restaurant it's one of the best.  This is in terms of how the business is run and the restaurants itself.  My love affair of grilled stickies began here.  I may have occasionally shoved one or two in my mouth as soon as they came out of the oven.  I also can't resist a smiley cookie.  They seem to be at every event in the city so I never have to go long to fulfill on my smiley cookie cravings.  Thank gawd!My all time favorite salad is the grilled chicken and portabella salad.  I absolutely love the balsamic dressing and mix of fresh ingredients.  I also had a second in High School (when I didn't have to count so many calories ew) where I'd order a Super Burger every lunch break.  They are seriously addictive with their super secret sauce combination.  Their breakfast buffet is bomb!  I always have to go for the regulars and one word sums that up.  Carbs.  Pancakes french toast and those delish strawberry muffins!  And seriously what is up with how good their pistachio whip is on the buffet?  I used to lick the bowl...after it was already made and served...don't worry for all you germaphobes!  Needless to say I helped myself to A LOT of samples over the years to be a complete Eat n' Park expert!
