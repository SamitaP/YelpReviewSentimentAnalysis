Namaste is not the best Indian food in the area but it's the closest to our house and we go for their lunch buffet which I will rate as good but not great. They almost always have that Indian buffet staple channa masala and maybe 2 or 3 other veggie dishes a couple of meat selections such as lamb curry or chicken tikka masala and a cold salad bar with lettuce and raw veggies pickles chaat masala and raita. If you arrive early and not all of the items are out on the buffet they bring it to your table which is nice. Dessert is almost always gulab jamun and chai tea which you help yourself to. On a couple of our visits they had tandoor chicken wings and they were to die for but these aren't always available.  I would have rated this place 4 stars but it can be inconsistent from visit to visit.
