My three stars are for the decor wow so much to see! There was a giant mural on the wall to the left of our table with just about every iconic figure from Kermit the Frog to Einstein really it was a sight to see. My little sister little bro and I had a blast playing where's Waldo while we waited for our order's to be taken. The  decor and wall murals were about the most interesting thing about our dining experience.For a meal for 3 people I spent $50 ouch that's a little high for a hotdog shop and something I wasn't expecting such a high bill.The kiddies did enjoy their meals we got cheese and chili fries a mason Dixon dog a red alert dog  two beef dogs with mustard and ketchup two drafts of pumpkin ale(for me) and a Philly cheese steak. The dogs are  bigger than average but the chili tasted like your standard chili from a can I was hoping that with the price tag of $5.00 a dog the chili would have more character. My little bro proclaimed at the end of his meal I'm full I've never  been full off of two hotdogs!I'll do anything to put a smile on kids face even though the food fell flat the restaurant was fun and we smiled laughed and jokes through a rather mediocre meal.
