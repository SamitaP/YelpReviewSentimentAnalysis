The gyro wedgie is my go-to menu item and it's awesome  but I've also had their pizza and for the price it's just alright.  I would have rated them higher but sometimes they just don't answer the phone during their posted business hours.  This led me to try other pizza places in the neighborhood and I saw what I as missing. If you want a gyro wedgie don't go anywhere else  but if its just pizza your looking for I highly recommend going elsewhere (Doughboys DiPietro's or Cerasoli's...just to name a few).
