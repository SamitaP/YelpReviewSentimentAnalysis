This was my boyfriend's choice for his birthday dinner. We had both heard great things plus we love BYOB spots. I'll start with saying that the service was great. Our waitress made us feel like regulars that have been frequenting the restaurant for years. We both ordered specials. They were different preparations of fish. Both were really good. Everything we tasted was wonderful. The downfall was when we got the check. The specials were both $30+. They were good - but not that good! You can find great Italian food elsewhere and skip the $100 tab.
