Beto's is one of the childhood memories I'm most fondest of. I remember dear old dad and me getting in the car driving to Banksville road and getting a few slices. I remember that crusty bottom crust the simple sauce of just tomatoes the cool cheese on the top and gooey cheese closer to the hot crust. This is a unique pizza. You get crunchy chewy warm and cool in each bite. Now if you take it home the cheese will melt(by the way this is the best cold breakfast pizza you'll ever have!) but if you do like locals do you'll eat it there and enjoy it the way it's supposed to be eaten. The bread fresh from the oven cold full fat mozzarella spread on top. Then when you order a slice or two some very nice Beto pizza chef with a heavy hand will put at least a quarter pound of cheese on each slice. I must get to Beto's soon and have a slice or two and think back to childhood memories and dad.
