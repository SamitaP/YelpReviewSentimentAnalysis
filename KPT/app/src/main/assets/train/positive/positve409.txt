Good food.  I guess one reason I like this place is they don't hide how bad the food is for you. There is a little Kiosk with all the calories right by the door.  All in all I get the flat bread pizzas and really enjoy themThe steaks are also good and the price is reasonable.Service is always friendly and the establishment is kept really clean and neat
