I've been to this restaurant with my husband twice once for dinner before I moved to Pittsburgh and once for brunch a few months ago and both were great meals. When I went for dinner they accidentally threw away my doggy-bag instead of giving it to me but they offered to make me a new order so it worked out fine. When we went for brunch it was quite crowded and we had to wait a while before getting seats at the bar. The food is really fantastic though and there are good vegetarian options. It's pricey but worth it if you're celebrating a special occasion. Seems like it would be perfect if you're looking for a romantic place to impress a date.
