I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal so I was pleasantly surprised when our food was flavorful (some reviewers complained of blandness) and not trying to imitate meat (some reviewers said that seemed to be the goal) but exploiting the wonderfulness of vegetables and scrambled tofu (which despite the other complaints was just fine). We had the tenders appetizer with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy heavily peanut-flavored but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!) but the apple panini (with seisage cheese etc.) was very good. Finally Panchu had the coconut burrito which was huge but he ate the whole thing and was very happy. We all split a vegan cinnamon roll for dessert and I really wish I had been able to get my own!Some complained about the wait; I think this place fits well with the slow food movement. If you want fast food go to McDonald's.So based on one observation I gave it five stars. YMMV.
