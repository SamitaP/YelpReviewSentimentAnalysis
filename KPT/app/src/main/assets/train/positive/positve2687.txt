I was fortunate enough to find this restaurant for a delicious lunch while traveling in the area.  I went off and performed my seminar then decided to return for a late supper. I sat at the bar and was served by a young woman whom I had assumed was the owner based on her superb professional demeanor. She informed me she was a 'very new' server.  WOW Araci's hold on to this gem.  As it was late I decided to create my own supper from various appetizers. One was better than the next by the way but I also wanted to point out that this 'very new' server had such a unique way of suggesting additional culinary delights even this seasoned traveler was hooked and glad he was! Everything she suggested was perfect.  My only regret is I don't live closer to Pittsburgh so I might be able to return.
