The food was delicious. But it is a ridiculously expensive restaurant. If you're intimidated by spending $100 or more on a complete meal for 1 person then this is not the place for you. Knowing that we had other plans for our evening my date and I cut the meal short with appetizers salad and a bottle of one of the lesser expensive wines they offer which was $54 a bottle. Our check was still $120 and we left hungry. Which is a shame because the little of what we did have we fully enjoyed. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh and many of them are very very good - where one can enjoy a meal for a fraction of what it costs here.
