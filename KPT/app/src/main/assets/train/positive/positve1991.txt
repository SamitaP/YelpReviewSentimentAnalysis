Cain's is a TREASURED INSTITUTION in Dormont and of course it's a neighborhood favorite  It's a lot better for those of us who don't live in Dormont now that there is a parking lot across the street but do be careful if you are attempting to cross West Liberty Avenue during rush (happy) hour!  I've been stopping at Cain's since I can't remember when and maybe their tap selection has something to do with that.  I have never failed to find something interesting and crafty on tap at Cain's.My favorite night to stop at Cain's is Wednesday.  I try to get there early because later in the evening the place is usually packed out even though there is a lot of seating.  On Wednesdays Cain's has a special on their excellent chicken wings.  They are done the right way and among my top favorites in the South Hills.You can't go wrong at Cain's during happy hour.  Half price on all appetizers and a dollar off all drinks from 5 to 7.  But my favorite plan of attack at Cain's is to arrive around 4:45 and order the half sandwich and a soup deal they call express lunch.  It is served until 5:00 and you can't beat a half sandwich and two sides for $5.99.  By the time my food arrives it's happy hour and the beers are a buck off but you have to be seated in the bar area supposedly.  My favorite sandwich to get with this deal is the Reuben served with some volcano chili and slaw but I've had other interesting sandwiches there as well.  The chili has got some NICE punch to it and I am definitely a fan.I remember way back when this place wasn't so pretty but they have done a nice job with updating the place and you won't be embarrassed to bring a date to this place.  But don't be surprised if you end up having to stand for quite a while before you can get a seat on a Wednesday night.  Chivalry is not dead in Dormont which is one of my favorite parts of the South Hills and I have seen young men give up their seats in favor of older ladies at Cain's.  Good people.
