I'm a fan of Betos. I like the fact that the cheese isn't always melted. The slices are square and the prices are reasonable. Ranch dressing or bleu cheese and you're good to go! The pizza itself is simple: crust sauce and cheese. I'm pretty certain that you have to go pick it up or that's just been my traditional order of things. It's been a while since I've had their pizza but it's definitely worth the trip.
