Frosty drafts the best veggie dog I've ever tasted and delicious whole wheat-crust pizza.  Thankfully since their beer selection is vast and ranges from relatively cheap to ridiculous the food is generally well-priced.  Toning it down on the drinks can easily bring your bill down to a manageable twenty bucks for two people.  They get a little extra bump from me because they so graciously hosted the Pittsburgh Beer Society for a long time AND gave PBS members 10% off their beers.  The downside?  Service can be spastic and I've never seen each person at a table get each of their meals at the same time.  One person can scarf down two (delicious) Chicago dogs long before their partner receives their (equally delicious) calzone.  But Omar hipsters and yuppies?  Aside from the occasional pair of skinny jeans and a trucker cap or two I've seen mostly families taking advantage of D's great prices and groups of friends chatting and sharing drinks.  It's definitely not a place to go to see and be seen which suits me just fine.
