Awesome Italian cookery! Very fine food with perfect wine selection. Me and my friend ordered the meatball as the appetizer. For entree we had a meat pasta and a pork shank! The pasta are really thick and nicely stretched and the sauce is yummy as well! The pork is of high quality and braised so appropriately that it still tastes great after getting cold. We also had two desserts: the banana n coconut pie and the tiramisu! Both desserts are served w cream and taste fantastic! The pie has a very banana-ish texture with pieces of coconuts in it. And the house special tiramisu is made from raspberries and almonds instead of espresso or coffee. The two of us usually need one or two boxes for leftovers but the food here is so delicious so we ate them all. I will definitely come here again!
