The pizza deserves 5 stars it's not like any other pizza on the planet. Nice hot crispy crust with cold cheese& toppings thrown on at the last minute before serving. Definitely an awesome experience but the bad... I've had the steak hoagie which cannot be more straight forward steak-um(unseasoned) LTO and cheese. Just stick to the pizza. You won't be disappointed
