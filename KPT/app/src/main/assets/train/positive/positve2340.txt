A day after the St. Patty's day libations the only thing I'm craving is some greasy junk food. Regent square hits the spot with some chili cheese fries straight from D's. Normally I enjoy fishing around the plentiful selection of booze. A hair of the dog was not gonna happen that hangover Sunday. I stuck to shoveling high calorie food into my gullet instead.The last time I was here I selected from the hot dog menu and they weren't that great. How can you mess up a frank you may be wondering?  I can only guess that it's the dogs themselves or the way they are prepared. They're kinda chewy. Dormont dogs rallies but the best Dog I've had was at Dirty Franks in Cbus OH. The chili cheese fries are good though. So today I made sure to get my fries fix in and try a burger. This weekend I had burgers on the brain! My BF and I got the Balboa the BBQ Texas and two dogs mac n' cheese and Mason Dixon with with cheese.The burgers had really delish toppings but the meat was so dry. It was overcooked and did not have one bit of juicyness dripping down my hand. Missing that major component they were truly lackluster. The macaroni dog wasn't that great either. Mac n' cheese should be creamy salty buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon! The crunchy-ness of the coleslaw made a huge difference but the meat was still chewy and too salty. Could it be that I am too picky when it comes to my meat? If I am shopping for picnic eats I do go for Smith hot dogs WITH the casing or the large sized Hebrew Nationals. Now those are the mouthwatering crowd pleasers I'm talkin' about!
