My friend and I have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. For a Thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. There were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. We ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). I was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. I even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist not dried out. This wasn't bad for a first visit so I will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. I'm only giving Uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. Hello! The plate was yellow! How could she not have seen that?!
