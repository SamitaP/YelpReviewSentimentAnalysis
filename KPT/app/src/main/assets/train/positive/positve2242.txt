Friday evening my folks called me up and said they were out toward Mt. Lebo and asked if my wife and I wanted to meet for dinner. We said sure and they chose Bado's.The place is nice with a warm inviting atmosphere. Our server was friendly but clearly dealing with to my tables. He actually made me feel anxious when he'd stop by!My family decided to split a traditional pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. My wife and I added a dozen Guinness/ Honey Mustard wings and split a Reuben.The wings came out in record time and were pretty good. Although I still don't think the Guinness aspect did anything for the flavor. They sure tasted like any other honey mustard wing I've ever had.The Reuben was average but very large. It came with potato chips and a pickle spear. For the $9 price tag you'd think they could do fries over chips.The pizza was good; not great. Based on reviews I thought the pizza would be even better. Maybe I'm being a bit picky but there are enough great pizza joints in the city that you can afford to be.All in all Bado's is a nice place to have a casual dinner. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it but if you're local give it a go. If you want an inviting atmosphere where you can enjoy a beer have some pizza and enjoy the company of friends or family this won't disappoint.
