I just moved into a new place in highland park and realize this place was right next door. I'm a huge fan of coffee and have never been quite satisfied with the taste ever since my trip to Italy(where there coffee is to die for). This place makes me happy with coffee again. I've also had lunch here and bagels for breakfast both very delicious. This is my new place!
