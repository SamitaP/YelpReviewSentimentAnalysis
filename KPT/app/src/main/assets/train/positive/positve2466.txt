Went here today for the first time and I couldn't be more pleased with my experience. We sat downstairs in the dining area on the same side where they keep all their beers. We were seated immediately and our server was quick to greet us. My boyfriend and I each ordered a draft beer. He had an IPA by Sierra Nevada and I had the Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter. Both were awesome and their draft list is decent. About 15-20 craft beers on tap. We each ordered a sandwich. Their menu wasn't large but they had more than just your typical bar food definitely more interesting items. I got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua--chicken avocado cheddar cheese salsa and jalape√±os. It was amazing! Their sandwiches automatically come with chips (which I'm never a fan of) but I was able to substitute them for French fries. Their fries were amazing they were the kind that are battered and those are my favorite (very few places around the burgh sell them like that) so this was very exciting to me. Overall the price isn't bad either which was awesome. After dinner my boyfriend and I both go my 6 packs to go.. They have an awesome selection.. Over 1000 beers in their beer room (all beers are warm) but they do also have a cooler which has less beers but still not a bad selection. I honestly couldn't be happier with my experience.
