Worth going for the booze and cheese alone! I have heard so much about this fab place.It's in a rando area in Allentown but totally worth the trip!I went and drank the blood orange caprahina and it was definitely worth $9. Not only was it delish but it came in a decently-sized glass too. I also had it with their mozzarella appetizer. I was surprised when it came to the table because it was literally a giant ball of cheese but I crammed that puppy down real fast. Yum!
