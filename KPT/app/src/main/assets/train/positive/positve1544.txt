After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.We were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter sauerkraut relish and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.Our waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle but in my opinion it was terribly bland and watery.Overall Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel) but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus actually.
