Another place I've been going with my family for years. Triangle Bar has huge (26) battleship subs for very cheap! Our favorite is the italian which is perfectly balanced with salami ham cheeses vegetables and spices. My father loves the roast beef subs too.I love that it hasn't changed a bit in the two decades I have been going there. Kind of dirty barred on the corner of the street... but excellent food! On game nights you will see a stream of people picking up their subs.Now you know why.
