Say what you want about Beto's but it is certainly unique. You either love it or you hate it. I love it. But... this wasn't always the case. When I first went there after hearing my boyfriend rave about it for years I was nervous to tell him what I actually thought. Cold cheese? What is this nonsense. But after the second trip it grew on me. Now I'm hooked. Like other people have said when you want pizza you get pizza. When you want Beto's you get Beto's. If you're in the mood for a typical Friday night quick pizza place this isn't going to do it for you. But if you go in expecting it for what it is you may just enjoy it. Now it's always busy. If you want carry out call it in as I've found myself waiting 25 minutes when I thought I'd swing by and pick up a few slices. If you want to eat in prepare to wait for a table at peak times. Then try to awkwardly make a mad dash to the next available table while competing with 4 other people.  Since I've been going in there most of the people working are nice. There's one bad apple who seems to be a total snot and I can't stand her waiting on me. But there are a bunch of other nice ones to make up for her 'tude. I've heard the other food is great. I've only had the onion rings and they are awesome. So try it out if you don't like it you're not alone but if you love it you're a member of the cool kids club.
