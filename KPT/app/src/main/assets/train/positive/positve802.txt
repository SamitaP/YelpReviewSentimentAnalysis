What a cute little coffee shop in such an idealistic setting!  I sat amongst the gathered hipsters moms friends ladies who lunch power business lunch people in a sunny little corner of the room sipping my delicious Indian Spice black tea.Service was very friendly and looking at the fresh pastries and lunch list of homemade soups and sandwiches made me want to come back and enjoy a leisurely afternoon or perhaps work day here taking in all they have to offer.  I was surprised when I asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didn't have much to offer.  Still looked like a good amount to me and I was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops don't offer (because well they're usually coffee focused!).  I also enjoy that they use loose leaf tea so you know it's not just coming straight outta a generic box of Twinings.  FREE internet is always a big plus with lots of outlets.  Now if someone could just find me an affordable house in Highland Park this could just be my next favorite neighborhood coffee shop!
