My girlfriend and I were in town for a vintage race (Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix) and were looking for someplace different to eat. We came across Max's. Wow did we ever chow down. About as authentic as you can get and that comes from someone who lived in Bavaria for 3 years and has traveled extensively through Germany over the years. If you're into German food I can't recommend this place enough. The atmosphere is spot on the service is great and the price is good. If I lived in Pittsburgh I could see me making this place a regular stop.
