The East End Food Co-op has just about everything you would expect to find in a food co-op except for--sadly--a great selection of local beers.  This tragic fault does not rest with the co-op of course but with the state of Pennsylvania.  But you probably don't care because you know where all of these elusive beer distributors are located.So to get back on track I like the local produce focus here and some of the cheeses appeared to be local as well.  Nice staff decent prices good little salad bar.  I love co-ops and if you do too then you will love the East End Food Co-op.
