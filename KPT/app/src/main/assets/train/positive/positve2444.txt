My cousin and I went to d's for a yelp event and it was awesome!   It was the first time I'd ever been there and I'll be going back.   We had wings hot dogs  and awesome homemade chipotle hummus.  They even had veggie dogs for my cousin! Everyone there was so nice.   If you drink good beer the beer cave will awe you. ..hell I drink Miller lite and I was in awe.   So many beers!
