My brother recently moved to Pittsburgh so my family and I were visiting him and looking for a place to go to breakfast. We settled on Dor-Stop. Walking in it looks like your typical hole-in-the-wall diner very small with not a ton of seating which is ok because they get people in and out fast. We put our name in and waited about 15 minutes then seated at our table. My mom ordered a egg white omelette my brother ordered a sausage an cheese omelette I ordered one banana chocolate chip pancake and a Western omelette and my dad ordered some pancakes and eggs with some sausage. The pancakes were amazing. Very delicious fluffy and large. . Everyone else was satisfied with their meal. If I were to get here again I would order just pancakes or some of their french toast. My omelette was good but nothing amazing. If you want good pancakes and french toast then I would go to Dor-Stop their eggs and other menu items weren't terrible by any means just nothing to write home about.
