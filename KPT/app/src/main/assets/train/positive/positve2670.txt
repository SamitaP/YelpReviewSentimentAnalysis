Food is what you would expect from a BB staff is friendly enough but the prices are outrageous.  My boyfriend and I had to endure the drive thru because we were running late for our camping trip. My toasted bagel was white and soft... before the addition of cream cheese. Prices are crazy! Don't be so lazy... drive down the hill to the GE... buy a 6 pack of bagels cheese and some bacon for under 10 bucks!  You'll have left over food and cash
