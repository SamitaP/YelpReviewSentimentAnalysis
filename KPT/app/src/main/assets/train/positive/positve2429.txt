I hadn't been to D's in years so when my friend and I took a hike through Frick Park and decided to stop by D's to grab some grub I was anxious to see if my memory of my past experience was on point years later.Well it was - great atmosphere staff and food.  I had the Chicago Hot Dog with a handful of fries.  Perfect amount of food and I couldn't even finish the fries...and they were some goooood fries!  I got my first pumpkin beer of the season from their beer cave and while I can't remember the brewery it was exactly what I wanted on a cool and crisp day after a hike.  This is a great spot for some craft beers and bar type food.
