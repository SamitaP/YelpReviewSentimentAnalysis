This place has the best beef lo mien I have tasted in Pittsburgh.  They cook to order so your food is fresh and isn't sitting out under a heat lamp.  My friend says the hot and sour soup here is the best she's tasted as well.  I like their pork egg roll but it is pretty different from others.  It is mainly vegetable (Cabbage I believe) and pork.  Their egg drop soup is pretty decent.I can't say I am impressed with their other dishes.  I've had curry chicken shrimp fried rice chicken soup shrimp egg roll.  They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien.  The chicken soup was horrible.  It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles.  Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places.  They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them.The obvious bad thing about this place is it is in a ghetto neighborhood.    It is probably not worth making a trip out there but if you're in the neighborhood I'd say give it a try.  They're cheap and they give you tons of food.  It is cook to order so wait time might be a little long.  You can call in and order as well.  Not everything on the menu is the best but they have a huge menu to choose from.
