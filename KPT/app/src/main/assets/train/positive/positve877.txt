Had a wonderful beef and pulled pork burger at Buffalo Blues yesterday. The food and drinks were great;however as far as I could discern this sports bar only had one waitress trying to cover over 30 customers. And this on a Saturday with the world cup games. I saw only one waitress and a bar man. The gal was valiantly trying to keep up. But the burger was great.
