Best pizza in the North Boros.  I can't make a trip to the area without stopping at Luigi's.  When I was a kid the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza but they've since moved to a new location under new ownership...but the pizza is still just as good.  I prefer the thin-crust but the Sicilian is also excellent.  The fried zucchini is a favorite and the mozzarella sticks are great too.  The calzones are tasty but may cause a coronary-- if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone you'll be disappointed.  Because it's Pittsburgh the chicken salad comes with french fries.  I tend to opt for take-out but there is also a mid-sized dining section.
