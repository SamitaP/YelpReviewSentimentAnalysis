This place was fantastic! My boyfriend took me for breakfast and OH MY GOD! He had the Guy Fieri version of the Italian Jumbot and I had the Apple Cinnamon pancakes. Neither of us have ever eaten such a delicious breakfast! Go hungry but make sure you bring everyone with you when you put your name in.
