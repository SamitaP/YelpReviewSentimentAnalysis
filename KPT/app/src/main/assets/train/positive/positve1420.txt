Alla Famiglia is quickly becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Where do we begin?  For starters I appreciate an upscale restaurant that allows for BYOB. There is a $10 fee.The table is set with fresh Italian bread and Holy Oil with banana peppers.  There is also a smal cheese plate served with chick peas and a goat cheese spreadAppetizer: Mussels in a tomatoe sauce was the best I've ever had. The sauce was amazingly flavorful.My veal chop was prepared perfectly. Worth the price of admission although expensive. We shared an entree and brought our own bottle yet still managed to drop $110.  Sharing meals is also acceptable there because of portion size. $15 add on that includes an extra salad and side of pasta. Only complaint was having dinner in the upstairs bar area where a Lemieux jersey was hanging on the wall. I love Mario however this isn't Fatheads.  I suppose the yinzer roots can't be completely ignored. In some ways it's charmingly Pittsburgh.
