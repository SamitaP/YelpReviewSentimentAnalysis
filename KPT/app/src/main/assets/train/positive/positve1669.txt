So if a restaurant is BYOB it has an instant star in my opinion even it is has a weird strip club-esque name (Legends though? Come on guys). So one of friends and fellow yelper lives in the hood so we decided to bundle-up wine-up on a snowy friday night and head for Legends. The interior was more retro than I was expecting not extremely cozy.  The menu is pretty standard with some rotating specials.  I decided on the chicken cacciatore.  Big portion. No pasta. Potato and veggies. I was stuffed!!Besides BYOBs I also have a weakness for restaurants that are walkable. Check.PROS: BYOB Friendly servers open kitchen large menu for a small place WALKABLE. CONS: Lame Corkage fees could use an interior face lift. Overall: This a stable on my friend's restaurant rotation so I am sure I will be back sooner rather than later! I am curious how this place will do with all the new development in the Northside. I hope it only helps them!
