One of my favorite places for take-out in Pittsburgh.  The ribs are cooked Southern style and just the way I love them.  This is extremely satisfying slow cooked wood fire BBQ.  You have to get there early in the evening to get the chicken.The service is quirky but I find it charming.  The decor is down home.The hot sauce is hotter than you might expect...so I recommend you ask for a mix or just go for the mild.Let's just say I every so often get a craving for Wilson's BBQ and it's always a special treat.
