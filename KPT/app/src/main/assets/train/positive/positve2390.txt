D's is a great dive bar in Regent Square.  I had a Chicago-style dog with bacon and fries to go for around $6.  The dog looked like a chef put some real love into it - it was picture perfect lightly dusted with celery salt relish tucked in like it was ready for a commercial.  The taste was perfect!  The fries were awesome - batter-dipped super hot crispy and just salty enough to not need extra.  I'll definitely be back.  Not a lot of joints know how to do a good Chicago dog.  Good cheap eats.
