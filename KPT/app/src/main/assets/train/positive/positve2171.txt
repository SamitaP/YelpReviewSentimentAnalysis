I've only been here once (yesterday) for breakfast.  I noticed that this place opens really early (6am) on weekdays so I had thought it would be a nice idea to get down to the Dor-Stop on our way out of Pittsburgh.I was able to find parking on the street and the meters don't take effect until after 8am.  We had arrived around 7:35 so I figured we'd have enough time before I had to feed the meter.There was only 2 other customers at the bar when we arrived.  We had our choice of seating and we had chosen to sit near the window.  Coffee up and ordered and our server was back consistently to make sure our coffees were filled.  On the table we noticed they had non dairy creamer and since both my wife and I aren't fans of non dairy creamer we had asked if we could have a small serving of milk and our server brought that over right away.Being our first time I had to go through the menu to see what I was wanting.  I didn't want to eat too much since I had to drive back home but I did find something of interest.  My wife usually gets steak and eggs but she didn't this time.  I had sort of wanted her to get that so I could have some steak but she went with the ham and eggs with German potato pancakes and white toast.  I had gone with the all American which was 1/3lb burger eggs and lyonese potatoes which is basically homefries with onions with toast.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  I noticed the side of bacon was 3.10 which is kind of a lot but they gave me probably 6 slices or more.  I'm used to only getting 3 or 4 slices usually.  We didn't order anything that they could impress us with I suppose.  It's not like we went with an item like hotcakes or a skillet or anything like that just a relatively conservative breakfast.  I did have some of my wife's potato pancakes and ham and they were both very good.  My breakfast was just as I expected nothing out of the ordinary but still very good.
