Who doesn't love being able to walk across the street to an awesome dive bar with a GREAT menu!My husband and I used to go to The Huddle once a week... They have REALLY good wings (also wing nights) and food including daily specials.  The soup was always a must have with seafood chowder being my favorite.  I always ended up ordering way too much food because it is so reasonable priced.  We'd spend $30 tip included (always at 25% because that's what a good waitress deserves) and leave with boxes of food! Definitely a place to be checked out!!!
