This is what a diner should be.  Yummy fresh(ish) food with staple american bites like burgers and meatloaf sandwiches.  Cramped with experienced servers that leave the check on the table with the food.My soup was the meal's highlight- obviously made from scratch in the kitchen.  Reuben burger- pretty good.  Side of fries- okay.  came from the freezer but were served hot.I would dine again.  if i am ever awake during their hours of operation.
