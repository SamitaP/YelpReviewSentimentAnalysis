Why do I give this place 5 stars? Finally authentic German food! The service was quite stellar as well and it's old school charm is certainly a plus. But I can promise you you won't be disappointed with the authenticity of home cooked style German cuisine. I'm from Los Angeles and we have nothing this good there.
