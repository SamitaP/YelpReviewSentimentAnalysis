My husband & I have been here probably a dozen times.  Never once have we had a bad experience.  The menu has a large variety and everything we've tried has been excellent!...best wings I've ever eaten!!!   Portions are huge and very reasonably priced.  Huge beer selection.  Bartendars are quick & friendly.  Great place to watch games....tons of TV's.   Only con:  The bar area isn't that big so it fills up quickly.  Oh and the parking lot that was across the street is no longer there!
