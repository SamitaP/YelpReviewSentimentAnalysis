The Teutonia Männerchor is a private club promoting German cultural traditions in the Pittsburgh area. It has over 2000 members from all walks of life. Mostly the Männerchor is known for its Ratskeller bar and lunch restaurant and the many German cultural food festivals it has throughout the year. At Lunch you often find a good German buffet and inexpensive German beers from their bar. Their German cultural festivals are usually well done and very authentic but mostly populated by an older crowd. Membership (or the company of a member) is required to eat at the Ratskeller for lunch but non members can attend their German festivals. This place is by far the most authentic German club in the area and the food is mostly good. The beer selection is great and the prices for everything are reasonable. If you like German food or have a connection to Germany you should try this place at least once.
