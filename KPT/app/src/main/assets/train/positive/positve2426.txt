I'm in love.  I came from a place where there were hot dog stands all over the place and found that in general Pittsburgh is lacking in that area.  Craving a hot dog I found D's on Yelp and figured I would give it a try.  I was intrigued by the specials menu so I started with an order of wings and Buffalo wing hummus.  This Buffalo girl was pleased.  The wings were tasty and done perfectly.  And the hummus was so good I wanted to ask for the recipe.  The flavor combinations of the hot dogs were crazy.  Who would ever think of putting pineapples and bacon on a hot dog?  Well I'm glad they did.  It was an interesting mix of flavors and was very satisfying.  If I hadn't also tried the wings and hummus I would have tried at least two other hot dog creations.  Aside from the creations on the menu you are also able to customize your own creation.There is also a beer cave that I can't review since I didn't try any but it looks impressive.I eagerly await my next trip to D's!
