What more can be said about this place? You need to try the hot cakes!!At first I wasn't sure three of these would be enough. Sure enough when they came out I thought okay this is a decent amount... and then I proceeded to take my first bite.These are the fluffiest most incredibly good and filling hot cakes that I've ever had! I don't know how they do it! I made it through 2 1/2 of them before I hung my head in defeat. But it didn't matter because I was in my happy place. These cakes are absolute heaven and if you haven't tried them yet you are missing out!I never thought I could get emotional about food but this is one of those times. I recall my mom once craving crabs from a crab shack in Ft Lauderdale for over 10 years after having them once. I feel like Dor-Stop pancakes will be the equivalent for me. My God will I miss this place and those hot cakes.
