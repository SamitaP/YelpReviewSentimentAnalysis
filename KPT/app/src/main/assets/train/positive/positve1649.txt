This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The food is consistently amazing (I highly recommend the blackened shrimp pasta) the ambiance is great for a casual or more formal gathering and the service is tremendous.  The prices are also very reasonable.  I literally crave the food from Legends....you must check this place out!
