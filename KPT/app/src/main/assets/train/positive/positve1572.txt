I really like this place. It has a neat atmosphere where the entrance has a nice bar and then there are a few other rooms that have the feeling of a living room or dining room. I really enjoy their brunches but their pretzels are amazing. The one thing I don't like which is a bit disappointing is their potato pancakes. They are a little lumpy and not quite fried enough. With that said it is definitely worth the visit.
