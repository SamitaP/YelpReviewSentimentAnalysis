Boston has Cheers.  Dormont has the Dor-Stop.  When I moved to Dormont a few years ago I was told about this amazing breakfast place that was featured on the Food Networks show Diners Drive-Ins & Dives.  I now know why this place is a Pittsburgh staple - Delicious food Friendly service and a Cozy atmosphere.If you go on the weekend you'll typically see a line.  Don't let it turn you away!  It usually moves quick and its worth the wait.  It's a small diner atmosphere so i wouldn't recommend it for parties larger than 4.  Once you get inside I assure you that you'll be hooked too.I've tried several things on their menu - The breakfast burrito - HUGE and delicious with eggs potatoes sausage... The pancakes - dense and hearty!  The French toast - who would have thought cornflakes applied to this would make it even yummier?  And my FAVORITE - Vicki's Jumpot - Everything you could ever want in a breakfast!  Eggs potatoes ham cheese peppers onions... and though it comes with Italian toast I swap it for some of the best marble rye in the area.  Incredibly filling big portions but little prices and always tasty.Yes it's got to the point where the hostess knows my name when we enter - Ashley party of 2?  That's me!  I look forward to any Sunday I get to dine at the Dor-Stop.  Sometimes you've gotta go where everybody knows your name...
