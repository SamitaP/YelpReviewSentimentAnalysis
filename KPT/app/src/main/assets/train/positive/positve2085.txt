Crazy Busy!I followed some of the fellow yelper reviews and ordered the Eggs Benedict.    My friend ordered the Meatloaf Sandwich.All items were made from scratch.    My eggs benedict was very good.   The meal came with ham and layered over toast.   It was quite messy but I enjoyed it.My friend enjoyed her Meatloaf Sandwich and Mash Potatoes.Food - Very good - I cannot wait to go back and try some pancakes!Service - Good - The waitress was crazy busy.   I did have a longer wait than desired (just be aware when you want your check).Price - everything is between $5-10 on average per meal. I will be back.   (I recommned going around 2pm since they close at 3pm for easier seating).
