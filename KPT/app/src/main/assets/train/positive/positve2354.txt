How have I not reviewed D's yet?? I moved away from Pittsburgh over 5 years ago and EVERY time I come to town I go to D's. I can't stay away from the awesomeness that is the large walk in fridge of specialty bottled beers or the take away section in the back where you can grab all kinds of good beers you want. Oh and they have a little quick chiller for the warm beers you grab in the back so you can drink them right away :-)The food! Ok I love the veggie dogs on the bun just plain but I've been rockin' some of the specialty ones lately. I highly recommend the Chihuahua with jalapenos and avocado or the Mac n' cheese with...well mac and cheese. The housemade root beer is also divine. It's perfectly sweet and refreshing. This isn't diet food people! There are far too many (oh so lovely) temptations at D's. Splurge and get the cheese fries to share. A small is good for 2 or 3 people and perfect with hotdogs.Once you get a table sit back relax and enjoy the goods.You won't regret it.  D's is definitely not a rush-in rush-out sort of place.
