For vegetarian food in Pgh this place is hard to beat. The quality of the food is very good but the kitchen tends to be slow so bring a friend/book/deck of cards and the serving sizes are somewhat inconsistent. The coffee drinks are OK but I don't come here for those. I love the atmosphere of this place very laid back cozy inviting. My favorite eats are the soups and the pile-o-hashbrowns (think haystack without the artery clogging gravy).
