Visited for the MCG Holiday Jazz event and this place exceeded my expectations on all levels -- food service ambience and entertainment.Food:  We ordered a small cheese platter.  The chef actually came out and explained the cheeses on our plate.  Nice touch though I have to admit to not necessarily knowing which cheese went with which explanation.  Nonetheless all were quite tasty and better than I would have imagined a simple cheese platter would be.  I ordered fish tacos which were quite tasty and my husband ordered the pork tenderloin the Novemberfest special which was also tasty from the bite I acquired from him as were the squash bites I stole.  Service:  Greeted immediately upon arrival and ushered to our table right away despite being very early for our reservations.  Offered drinks as soon as we arrived at our table and our server was always there when needed but not pushy when we weren't in need.Ambience:  We sat in the small dining area next to the bar and near the stage.  Cozy quaint warm feel to it.  Nice venue to hear the jazz band while still being able to carry on a quiet conversation.Entertainment:  I've been trying to like jazz for awhile now and not all that successfully.  Last night was a winner for jazz band quality and for the vocalist's quality.  Very nice indeed.
