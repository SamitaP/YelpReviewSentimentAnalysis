BEST pumpkin pancakes I have ever had in my entire life and I've had a lot. It was totally worth the 20 minute drive and the 20 minute wait. Moist and rich in the middle just like my favorite pumpkin bread and crispy on the edges. Didn't even need syrup.  There were a bunch of other delicious sounding pancake options that I wished I could have tried too like apple cinnamon and banana oatmeal. Vicki's jumbot was really good too - everything savory and delicious scrambled together. The ham from bone in it was what made it special and I don't even usually like ham. Next time I might just get a side of ham to go with my pancakes :) Service was great too - real friendly and everyone kept trying to refill my coffee as if their life depended on it. I'm not in Pittsburgh that often but I will be coming back to Dor-Stop next time I visit!!
