Hands down one of the best breakfast spots in Pittsburgh.  Okay maybe the best.  I can't say the best for sure though because I haven't made my way through then entire list of breakfast places around the city.  But I'm working on it though.  (I even have a spreadsheet.)I've had everything from the pancakes to the eggs burrito to daily specials.  I always know it's going to be delicious I'm going to struggle to finish the portions and I will leave happy both with my meal and the bill.  I'd like to be able to recommend one thing over another but I really can't.  Everything I've eaten at The Dor-Stop has been a great and satisfying breakfast.  The pancakes are sweet the bacon is always crisp and I can't find anything bad to say about an omlet special that includes bologna (aka jumbo).  I guess my best recommendation has nothing to do with menu items: go on a weekday.  Weekends this place is hopping and there will likely be a wait.  Sure it will be worth it but if you can swing by early on a weekday you won't have to and the food will be just as good.  A friend of mine will call me now when she has to take her car to the dealership on West Liberty Avenue because she knows I will take her to the Dor-Stop.  It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to share one of my happy places with a friend so it can be one of her happy places too.
