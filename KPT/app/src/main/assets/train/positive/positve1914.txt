You will either love it or hate it.  As a Pittsburgh native I absolutely love it and it's my favorite pizza.They cook the pizza without the cheese and when it comes out of the oven they put the cold cheese and toppings on the pizza. If you are eating there (and the pizza is best immediately out of the oven) the cheese will melt in your mouth as you are eating it.  The slices are big and they really load them up with cheese. Also the sauce has huge tomato chunks in it unless you ask for it without.As far as the actual restaurant they made a major upgrade a few years ago and it is much more accommodating than it was before. Prior to the renovations it was tiny with a few small booths and very little standing room.I believe this may be a strictly Pittsburgh thing because I have found nothing like this (other than a chain in West Virginia) that makes pizza this way. That being said every time I visit Pittsburgh Beto's is my very first stop after leaving the airport.
