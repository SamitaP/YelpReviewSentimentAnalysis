Max's is a nice German restaurant in the North Side and it has a decent bar too.  I'd much rather go here then a place like the Hofbrauhaus.  Unlike Hofbrauhaus you won't find live accordion music or dancing on the tables here but what you will find is a quality German meal.  I say leave places like the Hofbrauhaus to the tourists I want a real German meal.I went for lunch this past weekend and had a kielbasa sandwich with sauerkraut on it.  It was very good exactly what I wanted from a German restaurant and the service was good too.  The food was served with rolls and a side.  I substituted a spinach salad with hot bacon dressing for a side.I've been to Max's a few times and have been very pleased with both the food and service. I recommend trying the spinach salad with hot bacon dressing potato pancakes and the pretzels.
