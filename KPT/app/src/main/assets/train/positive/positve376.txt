This place was pretty good food but the service however was just horrible. As a friend said they hire for looks not work ethic. Plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous. Our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us. The couple behind us came in the same time and wasn't even attended too until after OUR appetizers were being cleared off. The food was pretty good but because of the service I won't be returning.
