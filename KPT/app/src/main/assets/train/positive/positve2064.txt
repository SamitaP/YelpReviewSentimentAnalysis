Another DDD spot to cross off my list. First one in the East Coast!I was intrigued with their pumpkin pancakes and raspberry stuffed french toast when I watched the segment on DDD. Finally had the opportunity when I visited by brother for his graduation at Carnegie Mellon. The wait time is killer so be sure to bring something to entertain yourself for the time being. I think we waited for half an hour but we weren't terribly hungry so it was fine. Finally sat down and looked at the menu deciding what to order. Both the pumpkin pancakes and raspberry french toast looked so good but I didn't want to be a pig and eat both of them (well I could if I wanted to). My mother suggested that we can order both items and split it from there. Brilliant! Get to taste the both worlds. :)Pumpkin pancakes were delish! A bit on the dense side yet still fluffy. Spices were so fragrant like it was Thanksgiving! Not terribly sweet but at the perfect amount where you don't need the syrup. Huge servings; your serotonin levels will rise. :) The raspberry stuffed french toast would probably have to be my favorite. The crusty/crunchy exterior of the french toast slices stole the stage. The whole dish was sweet enough that syrup was also not necessary.Their peach cobbler french toast special looked tempting but sadly they ran out right when we were seated. Sad. :(
