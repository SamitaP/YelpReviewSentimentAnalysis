First the Veal Milanese is easily the best veal chop I've had anywhere. Ever. And I've had plenty of veal.  Second the veal chop is definitely in my top 5 favorite dishes I've ever had ever. Fantastic restaurant. The relatively new chef has made this place even better than it was. This is THE most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Pittsburgh. Great service extremely friendly staff fantastic atmosphere.Be sure to come hungry. You cannot leave unsatisfied. Meals typically last me 3-4 hours but I take my time. BYOB is a bonus too. In summary Alla Famiglia is consistently the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Try it if you have not and you won't be disappointed.
