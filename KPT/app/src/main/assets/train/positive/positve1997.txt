We go here quite often for lunch. The food is excellent. Service is friendly but spotty. If your in a hurry for lunch I would advise you call ahead. I think perhaps the time it takes is because food is made to order. A great thing for the quality and taste but not so much if you have a limited amount of time. The lunch specials are a fantastic deal and no matter what else I get  I get the spinach salad. It's scrumptious. Definitely recommend this place. Dinner I have had a couple times and the food was good but the lunch deals are awesome!
