I have to agree with the hit or miss reviewers about Casbah at least when it comes to the food. I came here for brunch last weekend with a big group. They were very accomodating to us throughout the reservation process and the brunch which was good. And our waiter Daniel was great. The previous reviewer who said the Bloody Mary is the best drink was spot-on. It had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all. The mimosa and sangria were very eh. I loved my smoked salmon appetizer (and that did seem to be the hit at the table) but entrees around the table left people disappointed. The goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms and my scallop/sausage/grits/egg dish just had way too much going on. The grits were actually fabulous but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs (?) and sage sausage crumbles. If I lived in Pittsburgh I could see myself coming back here for wine and appetizers but I'm not sure I would make it a regular brunch or dinner spot.
