This place was really awesome and I wish there were more places like it.Boyfriend and I and a group of friends were in Pittsburgh for the weekend and I found D's on yelp.  The hot dogs looked delicious and my friends are real beer fans so we thought it'd be perfect.  It was better than expected.  First obviously the beer selection is amazing. You can either order off their menu choose a beer from their walk-in fridge or venture back into the Beer Cave (where they've got every beer ever) and throw a bottle or too in the chiller.  Five minutes later the beer's cold and delicious. We all took advantage of this and picked up six packs on the way out.  Second the hot dogs were really good. I definitely recommend the Angry Tiki dog.  Sweet spicy and really delicious. The only thing is they don't handle groups well. There's plenty of room but once we'd already split up our check amongst everyone's credit card we were told they don't usually do that for more than 6 people.  The guy did it for us anyway but it took awhile and I'm still not really sure who got charged for what.If you're in the area or even almost in the area make a trip to D's. It's definitely worth it.
