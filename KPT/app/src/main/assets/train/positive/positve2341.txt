This place is one of the reasons we decided to move to Regent Square. I am not really a huge hot dog fan but the BEER CAVE and FRIES keep me coming back (not to mention that it is walking distance from our house). We lived in San Francisco for several years and this place also reminds us a bit of some of our old haunts in the Mission. :)In the summer they open up the garage style windows so this is a perfect spot to sit sip beer (skip the wine though-- its not great) and work on your laptop or newspaper. If you are not into sports and just wanna chill D's has two sides so you don't have to feel outnumbered by screaming Steelers fans.  D's always has a nice mix of people as well- from young couples with kids students hipsters to elderly folks. The staff is really nice and friendly and the large mural of local Pittsburgh celebs is pretty neat as well!Yeah this place is one of the best laid back spots here.  I am in love with the FRIES! I know I said this once but they seriously do something very special to them that I cannot figure out.
