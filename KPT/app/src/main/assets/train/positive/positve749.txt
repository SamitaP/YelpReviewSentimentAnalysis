Based on some recent reviews it looks like the quality of food at Minutellos has slipped a little bit.  Still as I mentioned before it's a Shadyside institution located in the basement of an apartment building.  Anyway the main reason to come to Minutellos is for the pizza.  My cousin and I did just that the other night when we were in the area.  We did the whole 'Build Your Own Pizza' thing ordering ours with pepperoni green peppers onions and mushrooms.  Good pizza even if the place is beginning to look a little dated.
