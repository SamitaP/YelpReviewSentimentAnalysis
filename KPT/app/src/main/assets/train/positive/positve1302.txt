This is a good co-op with a generous selection for it's smallish size. Prices are better here than in some co-ops I've shopped at. Competitive with the big boxes as far as I can tell. I have tried some hot-bar/cafe items and quite liked them. The java jolt smoothie is amazing as is the lemon pepper tofu sandwich!If you can judge a town by its co-op which I am prone to do Pittsburgh proves to be a decent place to be a conscientious vegetarian shopper.
