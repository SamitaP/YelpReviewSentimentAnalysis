One of my favorite places to go have a drink.  There are really 2 areas each of which are well-worth the trip alone.  The first area is the beer cave.  Think high-end bottle shop organized by country of origin.  There are some really rare finds that rotate through plus all the favorites as well.  Anything in the beer cave (I thik there are over 1000 brands!) can be taken over to the eating area and there is a rapid chiller to cool down your unrefrigerated bottles.  There is also a large walk in fridge to grab beers as well.The eat-in area serves a variety of quite good bar food although I've only had the hot dogs once or twice.  The fries are great and the draft selection in this area is awesome as well.  Overall go here if you want a great beer selection and good bar food.  It's always pretty busy and the service is good!
