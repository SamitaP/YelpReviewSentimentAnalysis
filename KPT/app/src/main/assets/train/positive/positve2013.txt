Outstanding breakfast lunch or dinner. It is our absolute favorite place for breakfast. You can't beat their 'loaded' omelette. Quality ingredients at a very reasonable price. Their lunch combo's are so good. My favorite the Ruben and German potato salad. And their portions are large enough that we get two meals for the price of one. Friendly service you can't miss at Cain's
