What's better than fresh homemade free cookies?!Well a gluten free cookie but whatever I can still enjoy myself in sharing free food with other people. Max & Erma's is like the place to get everything. If I'd ever been to an Eat N' Park I imagine it'd be like that except classier. Well I don't know about classier again I've never been to Eat N' Park. But back to Max & Erma's...The location we went to always has a crowded parking lot. I don't know why it's so busy but there's hardly any parking there. Allot a few more minutes for parking. You'll need it.Once you're in though it's super fun. Build your burger eat greasy appetizers and taste some delicious milkshakes. I've had the lunch special - soup or salad or half sandwich for pretty cheap. It's just enough food to not leave you in a food coma after lunch. The only thing I wish (and yes this took away a star) is that there were more sandwich options. So sometimes I get the soup & salad and I'm still hungry. That's a no bueno.Then there's dinner. Their burgers are kind of fantastic. I'm still not over the whole eating a rare cooked burger so everywhere in PA gets added bonus points for that. So overall it's a good burger but it's certainly not the best burger I've ever eaten and there's nothing really creative about their burgers to make them stand apart from other place's burgers. The atmosphere is something between a TGIFridays or Chili's but very Pittsburgh-centric. I found it somewhere between comforting and annoying. I don't really like chain restaurants but this one had some nice personal stuff to keep it from venturing into the Fridays realm.Also if you're a craft beer & burger sort a gal you'll notice this place is not for you. There's more than Bud but not a lot. P.S. Free cookie night is Wednesday.P.P.S. Get the white chocolate macadamia nut.
