The atmosphere in this place does leave something to be desired butI have always left relatively satisfied. The food isn't quite as good as India Garden but the buffet selection is bigger and it's less expensive. With Indian food I only eat bread and meat dishes they usually have 4 meat selections:  chicken curry chicken in a cream sauce a grilled chicken with spice and the 4th varies. Overall worth a stop if you are in the neighborhood.
