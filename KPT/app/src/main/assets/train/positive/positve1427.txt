After a friend told me about her wonderful experience here I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!So on a cold snowy Saturday night we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.First off it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.The Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce cookies into coffee bread into coffee etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.Onto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it to be honest. It was just so so yummy.Salad course: Great salad!Pasta course: So I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...For the main course I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.I could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later though. I really cannot wait to go again.
