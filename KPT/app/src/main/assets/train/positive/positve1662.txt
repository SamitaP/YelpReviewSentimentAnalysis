So....what do you say when a highly rated place let's you down??  It was okay....When a meal rocks my world I usually want to lick the bowl clean yes like a dog.  I did not sadly feel that way about this place.  It IS BYOB but the catch is it's $4 PER glass.  Yep that's right not per table my friend.  Keep that in mind.I got the greens and beans on recommendation from many Yelpers on here.  Maybe I just don't have the taste for it but I thought it was weird watery and....not good.  I also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm Caesar salad.  No thanks....I ordered the Penne Vodka which is my fav meal to order at Italian restaurants.  I also like to add a meatball on if it's homemade.  It was in fact confirmed to be homemade so I was all over it!  The meatball itself was delicious.  I love a bread-y meatball.  You know the type.  Soft and packed with flavor.  It was the winner of the night.  The vodka sauce was good but I wanted way more.  Now I have to preface this by saying I'm a total sauce-aholic.  I love me a good amount of sauce this didn't even come close.  Then I looked over at Serena R's plate and her ravioli (which I thought was the same) was SWIMMING in it!  So I stole some of hers....Would I come back?  If someone really wanted to.  But I have a hunch there's way better Italian places to dine at in the Burgh...so now I'm on the hunt!  I gotta connect with my roots ya' know?
