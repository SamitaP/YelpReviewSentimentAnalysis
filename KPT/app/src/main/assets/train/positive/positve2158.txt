I have been here many times. This place lives up to the hype. You have to get the hot cakes. Try all of the flavors over several visits. I haven't has a bad pancake here yet . The flavors and consistencies are excellent. Easily the best pancakes on pittsburgh. They also have great French toast is pancakes just aren't your thing.
