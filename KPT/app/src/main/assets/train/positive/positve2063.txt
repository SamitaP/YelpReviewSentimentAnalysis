It's worth the drive over to Dormont. The owner realized I was a visitor came over and chatted with me and asked me to sign the guest book. I had not seen the DDD episode but read about it here and elsewhere. Bob the owner is delightful and the banana walnut hotcakes are amazing. I'm not sure it has been made clear but this is not banana flavoring but hunks of banana. Wonderful!
