This is pretty close to where we live so we eat there quite a bit. Freshness of food really is hit or miss. I like all of the veggie options there. I think it's a great place to take someone who has never had Indian food. Buffet style lets someone new to this kind of food try a bit of everything. The mango lassi is always delicious! I like that it's NEVER busy crowded or loud. Anytime we want to to relax for weekend lunch we head there for the chilled out environment. They are currently undergoing a remodel so I am looking forward to seeing what it looks like when they are finished.
