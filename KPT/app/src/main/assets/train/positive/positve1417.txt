Incredible food and favors. The location is very cool once you're inside but the neighborhood needs to step up!  People in Pittsburgh often judge food more by the portions than by the actual flavor and quality. This place would win on both fronts. The portions are embarrassingly large.  However the food is so amazing that you're happy to have leftovers in the refrigerator that you will actually reheat and eat...usually my leftovers sit in there until I realize it is way past time to throw them out.  Not so with this place.  The service is friendly and family-like.  The ambience is warm and welcoming. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this place...the bar upstairs is also very nice with friendly bartenders and waitresses.  The drinks are perfectly mixed.My next first date will take me here or there won't be a date two.
