This is your hole-in the wall diner. It lives up to the expectations and I will say this: get there early!I ordered something akin to a breakfast sampler eggs bacon tater pancakes.  My friend ordered the raspberry french toast. The coffee as others have stated was a bottomless cup. Quite tasty too as compared with many restaurants that will serve you the dregs of Folgers that essentially serve as methadone to the caffeine connoisseur/addict such as myself.The french toast stole the day it was hearty and delicious with a yogurt/syrup topping. Definitely an indulgence. I did not give this 5 total stars as my eggs were slightly bland and I love eggs. I will return to this marvelous establishment that really serves as a gem in Pgh neighborhood eating.
