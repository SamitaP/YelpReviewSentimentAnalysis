Let me start off by saying that I am unfamiliar with German food. I cannot compare what I had with what is served in Germany but I will describe my experience. I ordered a special which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with mini shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a variety of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst bratwurst and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion it was good but doesn't do well as a leftover. My dessert consisted of German chocolate cake. I know I know...how original. BUT I LOVE GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! And yes I do know that German chocolate was created in America by a man with the last name of German...STILL LOVE IT!!! I NEED to go back soon so I can try more of their food. One visit isn't enough. I had my sample and I want more!
