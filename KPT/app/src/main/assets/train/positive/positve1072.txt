I don't understand the high rankings of this place and why it consistently gets into Pittsburgh's top 3. The food is rather mediocre for the price. I went there twice both times paying close to $300 for dinner for 3 but the food really didn't stand up to expectations. Sea scallops that I have ordered last time were burned outside and rubbery and chewy inside. Risotto from my previous try was falling apart. But the most annoying thing is that there is way way too much food on the plate for fine dining place. The appetizer cheese platter that we ordered last time had enough cheese to last for a week! I don't go to places like that to stuff myself... So no I do not like it overall. Maybe it is one of those good enough for Pittsburgh kind of restaurants but then maybe they should think about charging a bit less. Unless they charge for quantity not quality...Service is okay.
