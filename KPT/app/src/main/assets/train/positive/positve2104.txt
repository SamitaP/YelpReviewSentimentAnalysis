LOVED this place! It seemed pretty busy late morning on a Saturday but it seemed like we just beat the rush we sat down right away. The service was great and the food came out fast. I wanted the egg burrito but I felt like I should try the pancakes too! So I got the burrito and the pancakes to share with my husband. The burrito was fantastic! The pancakes were so thick and had a cakey consistency. They were very filling. This place has been on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives my husband got the same dish that Guy had and he liked it very much. We left stuffed and happy and for a very good price. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again I will definitely go back!
