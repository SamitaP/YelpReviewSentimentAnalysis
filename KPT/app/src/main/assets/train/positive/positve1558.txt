I work on the North Shore and have heard many coworkers rave about Max's.  When I finally tried it I wish I had not waited so long.  Entering Max's is like going into your grandmother's living room.  Very welcoming and nostalgic.The menu is bigger than I expected with a variety of traditional appetizers and sandwiches along with a large selection of German items.  Everything from multiple varieties of schnitzels sausages chickens and a sampler platter that lets you choose a combination of all of the above.  All of the items we tried were full of flavor and served at the perfect temperature.  Speaking of being full the food is very rich so you will leave with a full stomach.  They have a good selection of beers and even offer a sampler option.  The dessert selection looked delicious but we were beyond stuffed so will have to savor them on a future visit.  I can't wait to go back!
