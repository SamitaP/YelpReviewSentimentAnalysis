After living in Seattle and going to a number of amazing diners I was thrilled to find Tom's. It tends to be a little greasy but I love the food. I've been there at least 6-7 times never a bad experience.DISLIKED that the bathroom is hard to find without asking.PERFECT hangover food. I will be back!
