Ohio valley square pizza by the slice...or cut(I should know better!) Crispy crust chunky piping hot tomato sauce cold cheese....but you have to eat it there! Loses its appeal if cheese melts and crust gets soggy.My family has been eating here since they ran it out of the old building next door! A real craving-type pizza with an acquired taste. Also a family of 4 can get out of here for around $25.
