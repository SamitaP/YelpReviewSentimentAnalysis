I have some errands that I run in Dormont every Monday. When I finish the errands I stop at Knossos every week to pick up a couple of Gyros to go for my girlfriend and I. It seems to be a good old fashioned family run business. The food is always good as is the service. It's somethng we look forward to. As a matter of fact when I headed out the door last Monday my sweetie remarked It's Knossos day cool!
