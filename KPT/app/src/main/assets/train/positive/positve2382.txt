There's no wrong way to eat a hot dog.  Especially if it's topped with cheese fries and coleslaw.Imagine if you will me sitting there and a myriad of punctuation marks pop up over my head as if I were in a cartoon.  My puzzlement showing because I have no sure shot way of how to accomplish eating this masterfully prepared awesomeness just sat down in front of me.  Or maybe it was because I wasn't sure I wanted to attack my Big Ben first or the pub fries I decided to order on the side.  My mind was buzzing...or maybe that could  have been the raspberry ale I chosen from the beer cave prior to me sitting down.  To say this hot dog is good is an insult to D's.  You better be prepared to say this hot dog is delicious out of this world life altering.......and maybe even orgasmic :O  The mixture of the poppy seed bun coleslaw fries cheese and beefy goodness....heaven.  Pub fries pub fries oi Oi OI!  Some of the best fried up taters I've ever had.  And to put some cheesy goodness on there was amazing.  But the best part was the cooked oh so right bacon that kind of melted in your mouth.  Sounds salty no?  That's what the ranch is for.I have no idea why I waited so long to try this place out I should be shunned for this.  If you are to shun me shun me back to the beer cave there are still several other beers I would love to try.The wait staff kind of remind you of worker bees.  Always in motion always doing something and very attentive.In all honesty I really wish I could give this place more than five stars.
