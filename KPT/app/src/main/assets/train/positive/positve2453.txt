I am a fan of this place.  I love the dogs of course.  I love the beers of course.  I love the Beer Cave the most.  I'm not sure if it's the largest collection of bottles but it's pretty impressive nonetheless.  I just wish that the beers I wanted had the prices labeled.  I swear every one I grabbed for had price tags on the beers surrounding it but not on the one I wanted.Anyway the dogs are tender and juicy.  Even the veggie dogs are pretty convincingly dog-like.  The fries are plentiful and pretty damn good.  Greasy and salty (but not too much of either) and a perfect accompaniment to beers and hot dogs.  The servers are friendly and helpful with the menu.Pros: great beer selection wonderful food friendly staffCons: I was here after brunch to catch the hockey game and they had NCAA basketball on instead; not a big deal but enough to be annoying
