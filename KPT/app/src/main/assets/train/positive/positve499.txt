I Love all Panera equally!I am def a fan of this easy better than fast food time-killing eatery.Great place for a lunch social/date with good eats and a good place to sit and talk for a while or to get some work done between appointments.PROS:Great Food;Free WiFi (though some locations are limited to 30 minutes during the lunch hour);Seating is always tricky at the lunch hour.CONS:pricey for salads soup and sandwiches;tables should be wiped more frequently--even if you have to ask a newly seated guest if they would like it wiped the tables should be wiped!For Pete's sake give a fork with the Mac and Cheese not a SPOON!  lol
