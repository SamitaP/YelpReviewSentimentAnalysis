I am SHOCKED to see this place isn't five stars. We order delivery from here at least once a week. Their lunch specials are GREAT and the portions are always always plentiful. I've never waited more than 25 minutes even though they always say 45. I think it's respectful just in case they run behind. I will say that if you are looking for a truly authentic Chinese meal this probably isn't your best option (although WAY more authentic than House of Lee. YUCK!) Both my boyfriend and I think it is plenty authentic for us always delicious. I have cravings for their eggrolls daily he loves their wonton soup. It is the only kind of soup I will eat it's that good. And we love the cute little Chinese guy that usually delivers our food. My bf and I always get the biggest smiles on our faces when we hear our apt buzz with  CHINA SEEAAA!! =)
