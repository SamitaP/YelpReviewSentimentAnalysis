Always great German and regular food. Much better than Hofbrau Haus. This is more authentic. They also have regular fare for those who don't enjoy German food. Other than Teutonia Mannerchor this is the most authentic German you will find in Western Pa. Cool beer selection and a great Sunday brunch. During Steeler home games they offer a free shuttle to the stadium when you eat here first.
