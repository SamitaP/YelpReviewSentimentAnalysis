D's is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. It's nice to have an easy fun casual place to get some good eats and a nice beer. As a vegetarian who still likes to pretend to eat meat I so appreciate their multiple veggie options. Nearly any item on the menu can be made in a vegetarian version. Their special dogs (dog of the month) are usually a lot of fun. My favorite was the Thanksgiving dog back in November with corn mashed potatoes cranberry and stuffing. It was amazing! I came twice to have one in November. Their beer list has to be the best I've seen in the city. Lots of great stuff on tap and a huge bottle room. Since we like to bring our toddler to dine with us I'm always so happy that they are so friendly and accommodating with kids. He loves their mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches though I think he likes their crayons more.For a fun family dinner a good beer watching a game getting together with friends or just experimenting with a new Belgian brew I strongly recommend D's.
