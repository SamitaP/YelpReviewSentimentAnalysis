Working in Allegheny Center Mall and being without a car there aren't many food options.  Pickles is one of the options and it has the added bonus that it is within walking distance but they also offer delivery.I have dined at the establishment and ordered take out several times.   Dining in can be real adventure because of the neighborhood Pickles is in.  One experience we had was fine another we were approached for money twice on the way in and two additional people came into the restaurant asking for money.My favorite menu item is the chicken fingers.  They come with fresh cut fries and cheese sauce.  I usually ask for blue cheese instead.  I've also had several sandwiches which were also tasty.  Nothing is out of this world memorable and worthy of adding stars but nothing is objectionable either.  If you order delivery pay in advance with your credit or debit card.  The two times I've paid with cash the delivery person claimed they didn't have change.   I had a $20 for a $7 order and was certainly not going to give that large a tip.  Thankfully there is another business in the mall that was able to give me change but it was rather frustrating that a delivery person did not have change available.Overall a decent food option for those living or working in the Allegheny Commons area.
