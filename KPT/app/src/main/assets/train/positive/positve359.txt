Service has always been good and the food consistent we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and there's some great deals on drinks as well.Things that stand out to me: veggie wrap fried zucchini hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter and house salad with ranch (their ranch is so good I could eat it with a spoon)
