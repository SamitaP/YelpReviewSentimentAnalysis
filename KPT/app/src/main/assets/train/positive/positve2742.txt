I prefer supporting our small business people  but sometimes convenience overrides desire.The Food here is not bad  portion size and price all seem ok  but the woman that served us was not very friendly.  No Thank you or have a nice day  just a grunt ? She did not close the plastic lid on my meal and the gravy spilled inside the bag  leaking on the car seat. She also forgot to include my cornbread. This place would do well to hire people who enjoy working with the public.
