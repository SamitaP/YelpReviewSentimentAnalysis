Located within a short walk of the hotel my girlfriend and I were staying at while visiting Pittsburgh Tom's came up as one of the must visit options near us especially for our pre-tourism breakfasts.The restaurant has a very old school diner shtick with old cracked vinyl booths and a red and white motif. It was almost empty when we arrived for a relatively late breakfast missing out on the commuter crowd. A friendly Greek lady who may have been one of the owners served us promptly and we were perusing the plentiful options before us.I decided to go with the gyro breakfast burrito which comes with eggs gyro meat tomatoes onions and mushrooms in a crisp griddled tortilla and slices of fried potatoes on the side as well as gyro sauce aka tzatziki. The meat in the burrito was crisp and gravitating towards the dry side of the moisture spectrum but it had a really good flavour quite similar to donairs here in Halifax. Although the crisp tortilla added a nice texture to the dish I would have preferred a soft pita for the sake of being able to eat it with my hands.The potatoes were OK at best. Some pieces had nice crisp edges but their texture was inconsistent and a normal hashbrown or home fry would have been better.If I was around for longer I'd have definitely tried Tom's again but alas it'll always be Dor-Stop that holds a place in my heart.
