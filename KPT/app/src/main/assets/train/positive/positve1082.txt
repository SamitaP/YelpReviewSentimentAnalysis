We love this Big Burrito establishment as it matures and becomes a perennial choice to enjoy no matter the season. It starts with a well-stocked bar area nicely lit and very comfortable. The indoor dining area is complimented by the (now-covered) outdoor seating area. Service was mostly attentive and very friendly throughout the evening. The wine list is varied and reasonably prices with especially fine after dinner selections. We started with two appetizers this time out the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean served with nicely grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce. I also had my all-time favorite salad the Arugula. This masterpiece features homemade pancetta crimini mushrooms and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach. Dessert was a nice assortment of house prepared sorbets (mixed berry/pineapple/grapefruit). Valet parking is complimentary; please tip your driver!
