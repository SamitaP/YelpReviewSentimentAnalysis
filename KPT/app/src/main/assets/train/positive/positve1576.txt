I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:Brunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station German and American breakfast and lunch foods and lots and lots of beautiful delicious and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years but I still love this buffet.Appetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.Meals-  I personally have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I also don't get too crazy and order anything complicated though.Sides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!Dessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly the apple strudel is wonderful as well.Besides the food the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.
