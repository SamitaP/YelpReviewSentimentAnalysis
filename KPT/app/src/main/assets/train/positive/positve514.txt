If you must eat at Eat N Park this is the one you want to go to. Why you ask? The corporate offices are right next door and the suits are there every day breakfast lunch and dinner. When I spend a few hours with dear old mom she enjoyed spending a day at the Waterfront she loved the since closed 39 center store where she could buy her monthly greeting cards for 39 cents each. Then we drive over to this eat n park where she has her breakfast smile and I enjoy an egg beater sandwich and fresh fruit.This place is spotless the salad bar always looks fresh and the food is good for a chain.
