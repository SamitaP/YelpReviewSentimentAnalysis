Came here on a Sunday morning. There was already a bunch of people waiting outside. Wait was about ten mins which wasn't bad. The servers were efficient and ran like a well oiled machine.  We ordered the special pumpkin French toast and the guy's version jumbot. The French toast was delicious. It was covered in the pumpkin spread which I worried would be too sweet but it was just right. It came with a few strips of crispy bacon. The guys jumbot was a melting pot of delicious ingredients including eggs  potatoes  jalapeños hot Italian sausage and cheese. At first  we thought it would be spicy on the account of the sausage and jalapeño but it wasn't  instead it brought the dish to life. The Italian toast really brought this powerhouse of flavors home. Becareful the portion is large and can fill you up quickly.  Will definitely return for another delicious breakfast one of these mornings.
