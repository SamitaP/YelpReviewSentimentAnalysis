Finally I restaurant in Pittsburgh that I can give 4 stars!! Mitchell's is located on the Waterfront and is one of the nicer restaurants in that area. The interior is a classic clean modern seafood restaurant-- dark wood glass etc... The menu has really great seafood selections and is printed daily.  But here's what's great about this place: after 4pm you can get small plates at the bar for $3 each and these ain't no Costco fish sticks! Two of these small plates would make a sufficient meal (along with the sourdough French bread they bring out). Finally while the drinks aren't cheap they're creative tasty and fresh. All in all I had a great experience and I think this place would be perfect for a date or a happy hour with the girls from the typing pool.
