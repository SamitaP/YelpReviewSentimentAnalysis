I was out with lesbian friend of Joe D the night before new years eve. Note to self: veggie burgers are not a meal for a man. After seeing Harry Potter 7.1 at the theatre we both proclaimed we were hungry for abnormal pizza. Let me explain we didn't want to order generic neighborhood delivery pizza. Pretty much I'm tired of tasteless no crust pies that lack nuance. Since lesbian friend of Joe D lives in Dormont Beto's was a natural. She's never had the beto's experience. So I told her to follow my lead I ordered two slices one with black olives the other was plain small drink. She ordered two slices  extra cheese and pepperoni. I forgot to tell her nay I purposely didn't tell her about the cheese because I knew she'd turn her nose up at it because the idea of cheese not melted on a pizza would surely upset the planets and cause disruption in the space/time continuem. But it backfired on me and the one thing I didn't expect was her to order extra cheese. We sat down and I explained to her the total stupidity of ordering a large drink in a place that offers free refills. Order a small it's way cheaper and this really sounds like a scene that could have played out on an episode of Seinfeld.Pizza time! The look on her face was one of shock like mine when I realized that America was indeed stupid enough to elect George Bust for a second term. The cheese was piled high and no visible evidence of anything under this massive mass of diary goodness. Like a trooper she picked up a slice and dived in. She liked it!After we downed our slices I told her how sitting here has brought me back to my high school years. The pizza still has that same texture creamy cool cheese warm crunchy crust and wonderful smell. Beto's is still my choice for best pie in the Burgh
