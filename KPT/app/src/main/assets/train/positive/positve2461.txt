For my 200th review I'm going to write a review for D's Six Pax & Dogs which couples a review I just wrote for The Loft- a bar just upstairs from here owned by the same people. I've been to D's a couple of times with groups of friends and this is quite a fun and neighborhoody venue with good food (amazing veggie dogs!) and great beer. The owners pride themselves in being a little more family friendly and it seems that this is true from the crowds I have always seen here. But fear not fellow 20 single somethings: this place can be for you too! There is ample room at the bar to chill with good beers to watch the game and also bring a group of friends to one of the adjoining tables. If I lived over in the Regent Square/Wilkinsburg area I would stop in here more often. However it has become a cool bar that I frequent before/after a movie at the Regent Square Theater. Cheers!
