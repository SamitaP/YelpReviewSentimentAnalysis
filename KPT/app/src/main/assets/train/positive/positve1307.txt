The bulk sections are amazing!!! spices grains oils nut butters pastas the list goes on & on. If you or someone you know is on a special diet this is place to go. They have a great selection of produce GFCF items vegan/vegetarian and a good meat selection for that carnivore close to your heart (all the meat is hormone free and the animals fed vegetarian diets) the hot bar/salad bar (of course you pay by the pound so it can get pricey as everything looks so delicious) and prepackaged sides & sandwiches make for a fantastic lunch or quick dinner. I go there 5 days a week for the soup alone.
