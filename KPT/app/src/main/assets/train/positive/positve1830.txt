It's past 10pm we're hungry coming home from a wedding party that served small portions of non-edible food. We're visitors from the West Coast know nothing of the area. Yelped for an establishment that is open late and still serves food within a 2-mile radius from our hotel. Voila! Yelp has sent us to Huddle. Not only did we get some bomb-ass fish and chips we got stiff drinks for cheap. WOW! I wouldn't mind coming back here just to hang out if we're in town again. Only thing is it's cash only. Good thing we still had some handy.
