I've only had breakfast here once so hopefully my review can be updated in the future. I thought it was good but I wasn't overwhelmed with culinary joy. The atmosphere is friendly and bustling. The menu seems nicely edited and apparently they make lots of their ingredients from scratch. I had 2 eggs over medium their in-house ham from the bone Texas toast and potato pancakes which came with my choice of applesauce or sour cream (I got sour cream). The eggs were cooked perfectly and the ham was nice-- just salty enough. The potato pancakes were different than what I expected. I thought they would be like fried hashbrown cakes but they were shredded potatoes mixed with a pancake-like batter. They weren't crispy or hot and just kind of underwhelming. I'll be back though since they have grits :)
