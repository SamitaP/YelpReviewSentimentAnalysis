Ordered delivery here with coworkers the other evening.I ordered an appetizer or what I thought was an appetizer.  The portion size was amazing that I had some to take home with me to snack on.  I only ordered the bread sticks but they were amazing.  Hand made baked and topped with oil and Parmesan cheese.  Comes with a side of marinara sauce for dipping and I was very pleased.The reason for the three stars was the time it took for delivery.  I believe from the timed the order was called in it took over a hour to have the food show up.  Not so good.
