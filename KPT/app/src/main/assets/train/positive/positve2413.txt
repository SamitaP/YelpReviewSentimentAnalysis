This is clearly not a place to come for a healthful salad.  As long as you can accept that and are in the mood for junk food concoctions taken to a new level (aka fried fries (yes they're double fried and extra crispy) topped with pub cheese and bacon and dipped in ranch) or one of their many unique dog toppings (such as the special Carolina Dog that was topped with pulled pork and coleslaw.)This is also one of the few places where any beer snob will feel happy and non-beer snobs can also enjoy a nice bottle of Lindeman's or the likes.  The place is especially bumpin' during sporting events so either come early or be prepared to wait for a table if the big game is going on.
