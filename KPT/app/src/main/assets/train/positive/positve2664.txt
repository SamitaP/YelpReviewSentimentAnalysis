We went to this location on Cochran Road a couple nights ago around 10pm.  We ordered the wedge salad an appetizer trio and the wings (which I ordered extra crispy).  The salad came first and was pretty good but seemed to not have any toppings except for the salad dressing.  The appetizer trio came out next and was a bit of a disappointment.  The potato skins weren't that good- mushy and no seasoning (salt/spice).  Also the bacon was soft and mushy.  The nachos were edible but nothing to write home about- again a little mushy once you got below the ones on the top and the guacamole was pretty bland.  The buffalo chicken planks were a little under-cooked for my taste but were otherwise good.  The buffalo wings came out last and I was happy with them- they were done (crispy) the way I like them.  The wings were what I was craving when I walked into the place- the void was filled.  The service was a little slow.  We sat at the bar and there were only 2 other people at the bar and only 1 table with 4 people elsewhere in the place.  They seemed to be starting to close up at that time.  It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks because the bartender dropped a wine bottle- so we had to wait for him to clean it up and hear his amazing account of the accident before being served.    I would go back again the next time I crave wings (because decent wings are really hard to find in the South Hills).  Maybe during the day the service will be faster.  I will definitely order the wedge salad again and the wings but will be more careful when ordering the appetizer.
