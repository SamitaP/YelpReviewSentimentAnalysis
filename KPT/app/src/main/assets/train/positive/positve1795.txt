Stopped here after a wedding and it was delicious!  My mom had the blt hoagie she said it was the best blt she's ever had.  The bacon was crispy and not greasy perfect amount of tomato lettuce and mayo.  I had the gyro.  The meat was perfect and it was a very large portion.  My sister had the fried zucchini and popcorn shrimp and fries.  Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious.  Plus reasonably priced.  We'll def go there again.
