Looking for alternative places to brunch we ventured out to Max's. The service was quite attentive. The brunch offering was reasonable but not overwhelming. It consisted mainly of waffles omelette station fried chicken stuffed cabbage potato pancakes sausage bratwurst bacon and a selection of pastries.The quality of the food was okay but none of the offerings stood out as memorable. If you are looking for a reasonably priced brunch you could do worse than Max's but you could also do better.
