I first heard of the Dor-Stop from my Grandma who asked to go on her next visit here to Pittsburgh.  Apparently she saw it on a little show call Drive-ins Dinners and Dives. lol.When we first got there it was quite busy so expect a little wait. ( Ours was maybe 10 min to be seated)  Wait b/c you will be glad that you did!!Coffee was typical diner coffee but I love that so I'm a little biased.Our server was friendly and efficient.  Our coffee cups never went empty so that's an A++ in my book.I  had the breakfast burrito and split an order of pancake with my grandma and boyfriend.  My burrito was HUGE!!  Stuffed with delicious eggs potatoes breakfast meats and cheese....heaven on a plate.  I couldn't finish but it made great breakfast the next day. The pancakes....oh my lord the pancakes....perfection.   They were fluffy and the perfect balance of sweetness.  So good! We just got the regular ones but they also offer specials. (the special that day was blueberry. Note to self come back in fall probably offer pumpkin pancakes.) My grandma had eggs over easy and sausage. She enjoyed both and liked that while sausage is greasy hers wasn't disgustingly greasy.  My boyfriend had an omelet that rivaled the size of my burrito. It was stuffed full of yummy veggies and meat.  I will never stop praising the Dor-Stop.  This little gem of a place is what Pittsburgh is all about.
