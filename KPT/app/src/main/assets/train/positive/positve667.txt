The food at Joe's Rusty nail is GREAT. As the pictures will show the servings/portions are plentiful. The service is quick and the staff personable. I went there for breakfast AND everyone in our group left sated!! As always I had my kid carnivores in tow and as is their custom they laid waste to EVERYTHING edible that was put before them. While they are a TAD (and I do mean tad)  bit pricey I believe that the food is more than worth it. The clientele (what I can only believe are Bellevue regulars) are polite and inviting. My breakfast was made well tasted great and dressed pretty as a picture. I will tell you this is not my first rusty nail rodeo and lord willing it will not be my last. As I say I vote with my feet and my USD and the staff at rusty nail can sleep well tonight knowing that my hard earned cash will continue to flow at Joe's and my feet will continue to bring me there hopefully more often than not!!
