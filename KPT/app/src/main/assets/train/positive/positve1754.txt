I came here just before a Pirates game so it was extremely busy. As a result I sat at the bar. I ordered the Pacific Salmon salad and it was absolutely delicious. The service was very friendly and attentive. The price seemed reasonable. My only issues were that there were some left over plates of food nearby that were waiting to be taken away that sort of detracted from the experience. Also my plate did not seem 100% clean although it really wasn't a big issue. Given how busy they were I do understand and still give high marks for the tasty food and excellent service.
