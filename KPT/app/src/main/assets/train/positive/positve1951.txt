Eat'n Park is known for their Smiley cookie (like a chewy black-and-white sugar cookie but white with a smiley face drawn in icing).  My wife insisted on going to Eat'n Park on our trip to Pittsburgh.  But she hates the Smiley cookie.  What drew her was the strawberry pie.The pie itself merits four stars.  It's inexpensive ($2.99 and a whole pie is less than $10) and bursting with fresh huge berries.Fried zucchini ($5-6) is listed as an appetizer but is enough for a meal and comes from a local farm in Butler.  The freshness really shows in the taste.  It's breaded with a cornmeal batter which produced some really tragic consequences for me an hour later.  90 minutes after that however I no longer regretted eating the fried zucchini.  Yes it was that good.  I wouldn't do it again mind you but in retrospect it was worth it.
