You know how JImmy Buffet has Cheeseburger in Paradise? Mine is more like Pancake in Paradise and this place is it! While Pamela's serves up the amazing thin crepe-like pancakes The Dor-Stop serves up the fluffy equivalent. The list of different combos goes on and on. And if you're with a really good friend you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!I split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!The only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides! I think there's some other stuff on the menu but who knows if I'll ever even experience them... how can I with those pancakes!
