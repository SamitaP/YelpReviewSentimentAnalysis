one of the best espresso bars i've been to.+1 for great espresso.  i had a shot of ethiopian espresso.  fantastic!  grabbed a costa rican pour-over on my way out ... perhaps one of the best cups of coffee i've ever had.+1 for baristas who pay great attention to detail+1 for great atmosphere.  the ceiling is tastefully ornate and the decor is pleasing.  hearty wood furniture used throughout.+0 for having a location a bit far from downtown.a favorite for locals and not-so-locals alike.highly recommended!  i will return...
