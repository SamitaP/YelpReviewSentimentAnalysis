Headed there for lunch today.  Great little place with excellent food. Foccacia bread unbelievable. ...... A must it's so good.Panini sandwich are great about 8-10$ s. Includes cup of soup or salad. Entr√©e s are from 10-20$. Homemade deserts good too. Had a huge piece of apple pie. No price on menu turned out to be 6.95$.So not and everyday place. It's hard to get a 5 with me. Go 4.5 if I could.
