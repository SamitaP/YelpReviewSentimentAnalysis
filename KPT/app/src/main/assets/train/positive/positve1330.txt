I absolutely love this place and wish there had been something similar in Orlando (one where you don't have to be a member).I randomly found out about East End when I was doing a search for organic local food products. We decided to go check it out and instantly fell in love. Their produce selection is second-to-none seriously. And yes I am including Giant Eagle in that!Seriously just about every time we've gone all the produce looks so fresh and brightly colored (i.e. the peppers tomatoes fruits etc.) and ripe. I also like how they carry pasta noodles rice and other fun things in bulk. We always lament about how since there's only the two of us we don't always need the large offerings that you usually find at places like Giant Eagle. Being able to pick out just the amount you need and not letting anything go to waste makes me feel a lot better.Beyond the food products I have also gotten into making my own body washes. East End carries all of the ingredients that I need with multiple options. They have recently redone their store (and are still renovating) and have expanded their meat (they didn't use to carry meat at all) and cheese selections tremendously. The meat is a little pricey actually the whole store is little pricey but in my opinion it is well worth it. It's nice knowing that the items are organic and come from sustainable farms. Bonus: they buy as much locally produced items as they can as well. I really have nothing bad to say about them. The service has always been great and I love the selections and products offered. I can't comment on the cafe as I haven't eaten at it but I hear the food is great. A combination of East End and the Strip has pretty much replaced Giant Eagle for me. I only stop by there now if I'm close by and just need a few items really quick.
