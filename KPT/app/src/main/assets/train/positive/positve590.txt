I have to admit the first time I hate here I absolutely hated the pizza. And I think it was because I was expecting something completely different than I got. Latina Pizza is very different from most pizza shops. Instead if a round thin crust pizza this pizza is square thick and doughy. The crust is not really that good but that is not why you get a pizza here. It's the homemade sauce. And that it is a family owned place that is  really pretty inexpensive. The other nice thing about this shop is that it is right next to Kennywood. So usually around dinnertime we leave the park and walk over here to order some pizzas and drinks. No lines no waiting for tables no outrageous prices. It's a time to recharge and sometimes we feel like going back to the park  other times we decide to go home.
