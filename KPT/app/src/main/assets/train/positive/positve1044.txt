Ah Casbah...  the epic tale of bi-polar experiences.As with all the other Big Burrito restaurants I'm definitely a fan of the upscale and unique spin on an ethnic cuisine (in this case Mediterranean).The fiancee and I's first venture here left us with some of the best scallops we've had in Pittsburgh and a Jamison Farm's lamb shank that was to die for.  I wish I could remember the waiter's name but all I can say is he definitely deserved the 40% tip we laid down.Take two brunch.  We sat this time out in the covered and heated patio up front.  While the food was great (I got my obligatory fat kid french toast variation) a rushed server caught her arm on the back of my chair towards the end of our meal and dumped an entire pitcher of ice water on my shoulder and lap.While I'm completely sympathetic when it comes to legitimate mistakes (and the server was obviously extremely embarrassed about the situation) I was surprised when no follow-up occurred.  The server apologized and ran immediately to the back of the house leaving two of the surrounding tables to come to my rescue with their napkins.  The server brought us our check but despite the public scene it caused not a single manager stopped by to verify that everything was alright.After writing to Casbah the manager did respond quickly and offer to rectify the situation so I'll give them a pass assuming it was just bad timing and an issue where the server was too embarrassed to do anything.
