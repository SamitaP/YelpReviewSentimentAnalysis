We have been wanting to try Legends of the North Shore for a long time and since we were right across the street yesterday we seized the lunch opportunity. It was not what I expected at all. Tiny I expected because I'd seen it driving by many times. Diner-esque inside completely unexpected. I knew they are BYOB but after eating lunch here I can't imagine any scenario where I'd take more than a couple of beers with me. Not a place to linger over a bottle of wine. Tables on top of each other cramped and kind of a low end divey diner uh uh.I wanted the mussels for lunch but was told they were out of them. Not terribly disappointed because our server had just run through the lunch specials and one had caught my attention enough that I mentally considered changing my mind anyway. A fried zucchini plank sandwich with melted mozzarella and side of sauce. I do love a good zucchini plank and had never heard of anyone creating a sandwich out of them so no hardship to change my order. That was a greasy good lunch sandwich....heavy on the greasy but I've always loved some tasty 'fried deliciousness!'Hubs had the sausage sandwich... good...but mine was the clear winner.Starter soups were homemade and tasty. Hubby had black bean and I had the chicken pastine aka wedding soup. The broth rivaled my premium homemade Christmas chicken soup broth so no complaints on that. Overall: ambiance 1star mine and hubby's sandwiches 3 stars soup 4 stars. Average is a 3 - not rushing back but I'd clearly have lunch there again if I'm across the street.
