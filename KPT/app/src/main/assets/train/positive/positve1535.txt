This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside possibly favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I tell all my friends that this little restaurant is the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating even on Friday and Saturday nights.  The service is good.  The food is great I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  If you are looking for a place to check out that isn't going to be as crowded and will be more authentic German food than other places you should definitely come to Max's!
