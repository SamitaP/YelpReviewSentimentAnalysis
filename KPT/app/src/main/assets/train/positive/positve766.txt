They just opened a spot at Carnegie Mellon on campus in the Gates building and it has changed my life. My closest coffee option before was Seattle's Best so you can imagine how delighted I was when this opened next door to where I have class all day.  The first week they were open I think I went there about 4 times.  The Italian Cappuccino will wire you for a few hours but is totally amazing.  Their basic coffee pales in comparison to their espressos though so stick with espresso drinks. I have also had two delicious paninis which I highly recommend.  Knowledgeable service. Great drinks! yum!
