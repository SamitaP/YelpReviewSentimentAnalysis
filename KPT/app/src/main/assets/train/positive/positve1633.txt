What can I say? If you like bread you HAVE to visit their store. And once you do it'll become a regular thing! The bread is baked to perfection and is simply delicious!  Particular favorites are:* Specialty Focacia's (different every day)* Asiago Mini Crocodile (perfect amount of cheesiness)* Rustic Walnut  Raisin (great toasted for breakfast)* Raisin Grain and Pumpernickel Raisin Rolls (I can't stop eating them)* Sour #2 (Get it sliced or slice it yourself for FANTASTIC sandwiches)The store is open until 6pm during the week and starts marking down what's left on the shelves at 5:30pm. But go earlier or even order ahead for the best selection! They also have weekend hours but I've not been to the store on the weekend myself.Oh and what they don't sell before closing? They donate to local food banks so even the poor can sometimes have a taste of ambrosia!WARNING: The retail store only takes cash so plan ahead!
