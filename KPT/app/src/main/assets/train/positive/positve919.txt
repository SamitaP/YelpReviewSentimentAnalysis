Some friends and I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight.  We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here and I didn't object since I'd never had pizza from here before and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.The pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it right about at the time estimated so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself it was solidly A-OK--nothing special but nothing horrible either.  It was a bit on the greasy side and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor it was your standard pizza flavor--again nothing special but nothing horrible either.  It was more greasy than I'd like but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).As the bottom line the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). It was better than Vocelli's and about on par with Papa John's.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again but I wouldn't object to it either.
