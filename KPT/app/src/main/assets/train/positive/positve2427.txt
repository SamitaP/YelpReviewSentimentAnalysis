D's Six Pax & Dogz is a legend in the east end. I have eaten here once or twice and gotten takeout from here once. It's tasty and the beer selection is impressive but the experience hadn't quite knocked my socks off until last night. My husband ordered some to-go food to eat while we were at the nearby The Loft bar. He ordered the Mac'N Cheese hot dog with Fries. The hot dog was incredible! The mac and cheese was so delicious that I asked one of The Loft's bartenders for a fork to finish off the 1/2 cup of mac and cheese that had fallen off the bun and was laying sadly in the styrofoam box. I wasn't wasting a bite of that deliciousness. The fries were really tasty too -- super crispy and perfectly seasoned.Based on my overall experience at D's I still rate this place 3 stars. However if I have a few more of the Mac'N Cheese hot dog and Fries combinations I may be quickly updating my review!
