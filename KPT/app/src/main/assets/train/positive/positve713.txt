I will admit I am completely biased towards this place. I grew up eating their pizza. Crust is soft and fluffy not chewy. The cheese is a little thicker than the average new york style pizza place. The sauce has spice but not too much. At some places you need a little milk or water to cool your tongue. Their one downside is that they're not always consistent. Some days its just started to turn golden brown others its over done.
