was in the neighborhood on a girls weekend. this place is fantastic.  great prices great slice.  service is a tad bit slow (since they make it to order!) but the food is worth the wait. they seemed to be doing a great take out/carry out order  If you are in the area stop by . . . it is totally worth it!
