Well everything is just grand in Pittsburgh when the October weather is so beautiful!! But we had a great 'lil Saturday lunch here at Atria's after walking our new puppy around the North Shore. They have plenty of outdoor tables (in the shade) and we grabbed a corner one with our pup. They were totally cool about it and offered water etc. The bf was starving per usual so he started with the crab bisque which he said was awesome. He also had their spicy pasta entree while I opted for a fresh house chopped salad and a glass of pinot grigio. The salad was super fresh and they didn't skimp on any of the good veggies. Only gripe is I asked for no crumbled bleu cheese and it came out with it. I didn't feel like complaining so just picked it off. The salad definitely would have been more enjoyable for me without it (I don't eat cheese) but it was a nice size salad for the cost. It was also an Oktoberfest special so bf got the Dunkel brew to drink. Our waitress was really nice and all in all it was a good experience. I would definitely come back!
