Why is this restaurant called SoHo? Is it an effort to capture the artsy-fartsy joie de vivre of Manhattan's neighborhood's namesake? Lord I hope not. The restaurant is located across from PNC Park in just about the least artsy-fartsy neighborhood of Pittsburgh. But I guess Post-Game Drunken Fratboy Hangout doesn't really have a good ring to it.Is it a nod to Pittsburgh's very own SoHo? Lord I hope not. The restaurant has far more glam than the rundown neighborhood trapped between Duquesne University and South Oakland. But I guess Depressing Shithole doesn't have a good ring to it either.Whatever the story behind its namesake is a moot point upon experiencing the restaurant's fare. Here's what you can expect:1. Meh food. The SoHo steak and cheese is essentially chopped steak and Cheez Whiz on a bun. It's not particularly delicious. The fries were good though.2. Outstanding drinks. Perfectly priced elegantly presented and expertly mixed. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch martini is ridiculously delicious. Honest to God it tastes like a friggin' bowl of the cereal. Except with alcohol.If you're in the North Side go for a cocktail during Happy Hour but don't schlep out for a special trip or for a memorable meal. You won't find it here.
