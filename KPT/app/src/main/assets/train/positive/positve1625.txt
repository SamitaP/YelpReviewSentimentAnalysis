I am a huge fan of Breadworks. They make high quality breads at reasonable prices. They are very consistently good and the bread is always delicious and fresh. Some favorites include the Walnut Raisin and the Sourdough.  A good shopping tip is to arrive 1/2 hour before closing and everything in the store is half off.
