Growing up in Swissvale we got a battleship for every football game birthday party and so on.. now in my late 20's my mom and I still have a ritual of going out to shop and then to each grab a battleship for dinner at our separate homes at least once a month. In over 20 years I can not think of a single bad experience with the place other than the long wait which I will forgive because it's totally worth it.
