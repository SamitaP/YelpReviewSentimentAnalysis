I am taking one star off for the following. The restaurant is very small and fills up quick which makes dinner conversation near impossible. To get the full enjoyment of Legends I would suggest going during the week after the lunch rush. I am so proud to have this as a neighborhood restaurant on the Northside.  I have been eating here for 6 years and every meal is delicious. I normally get the grilled salmon salad you can smell the delicious aromas of your food cooking while you wait. This is a restaurant that you really want to spend your time at. The beans and greens are so yummy too.
