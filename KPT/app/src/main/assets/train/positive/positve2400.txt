Awesome place! I discovered this when I was looking for a place to buy beer to go by the bottle that had a good variety then I discovered this place was a full bar/restaurant.  Besides getting bottles to go you can also drink from any of their many drafts on tap or their individual bottles.  Many are already in a chilled section but they also have a beer chiller machine that can chill a room temp bottle in like 5 minutes! And they have a huge selection of beers both imported and local microbrews.  They also have a nice menu with a variety of things including hot dogs hamburgers salads etc.  Hot dogs are one of their specialties and I'm not a huge hot dog fan but the bratwurst I had with bacon and mac-n-cheese on top was amazing! I also had the fried zucchini appetizer which was cooked perfectly and the sauces were very tasty (marinara and a spicy ranch-like sauce).  I went on a Wednesday evening post-happy hour and was surprised how super crowded it was so it may be hard to get a table on weekend nights.
