Best Mussels!!! They were large and quite tasty.  The starter bread is corn bread and it is absolutely addicting.  My boyfriend and I had dinner on a whim on a weekday and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The setting is intimate and I enjoyed it.  I only wish we would've brought a bottle of wine since it's BYOB. The service was excellent as well. I have no complaints even if it is CASH only I think it's worth it. NOTE: Cash only.  They do have an ATM inside for your convenience. BYOB
