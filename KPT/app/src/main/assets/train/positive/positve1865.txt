Tom's Diner is a bit retro a bit hole-in-the-wall and a bit of a good deal!The wait staff is super friendly and on top of the service the decor is retro and the booths are true diner style. I ordered the breakfast burrito. It was pretty tasty and very filling. The salsa it came with wasn't anything phenomenal but I'm ok with that.  The peppers and onions were well cooked the sausage was tasty (it's sausage not chorizo) and the breakfast potatoes on the side were just ok. They needed a little salt which I understand and I think some ketchup would've done them well.  This wasn't the best burrito I've ever had but it was good and super filling. I ate it around 9 and wasn't hungry until 4pm! Well done!Breakfast burrito breakdownThe food: It was good. It was great it wasn't bad it was good.The value: That burrito was just under $6 and it was a monster!The experience: it's nice and quiet in the mornings! I bet it gets really crowded though.Would I return?: Hmmm I don't think I need to.3 stars?: It was good!
