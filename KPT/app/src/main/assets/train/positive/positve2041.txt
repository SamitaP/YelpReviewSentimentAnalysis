Awesome food my french toast was great and bacon was crisp and delicious!  My wife's pancakes with bananas and chocolate chips was 'the best she's ever had'!  I was disappointed with the service the waitress wasn't attentive and rushed our order and  when i paid she barely acknowledged me.    the dinning experience was also rather cramped I kept getting my elbows bumped lolGreat food but rushed apathetic service.
