Food was excellent. Went for the Sunday brunch and loved it. I highly recommend the steak and eggs with the zucchini pancakes really an outstanding dish. Oh and if you get the carrot cake....one is enough for everyone! It was huge and it was soooo goood! I don't know how they can make something taste that good and cook it in such large volumes. Really was an excellent experience my only reason for not giving it a five star review was that there was too much time in between our courses. There was probably a good 40 minutes that passed between our salads and our entrees. That's a little long for me when I'm at a brunch. Usually I don't eat a breakfast if I'm going to something like that so 40 minutes was too long for me.
