we love to go to this place when we are in visiting the in-laws. it's a great place to meet up with old friends order greasy food drink craft beer and catch up in a relaxed setting. The place can get kind of loud at night so make sure your group of friends aren't hard of hearing. The craft beer selection is excellent. You can make your own six pack to go or drink any one of the unique beers in-house. They also have beers on tap for a cheap price. Food wise their wings are decent and the pizza is greasy and cheesy. The place is pretty bare bones 'burgh style. Not trying to be something it's not but still offering unique quality beer from around the world. For that I give it my fandome and return business.
