OK I'm going to be honest. I am SICK and tired of pizza. There are only so many ways to throw stewed tomatoes and cheese on bread. This being said it is difficult to impress me with pizza. It was Darren's turn to pick a place to stop for dinner and I groaned when he mentioned ANOTHER pizza joint. They have more than pizza he protested but pizza we got anyway. And WOW! Enter a seafood variation on the detested entree. I have tried seafood pizza at various places before and received imitation crab and some mini shrimp sauteed in butter but THIS pizza blows them away! Clams scallops and sliced shrimp of the larger variety covered a perfect crust that was both crispy and soft. If you are a seafood lover this is the perfect pie for you! This was an inexpensive way to cure my ocean tooth. As stated in other reviews the service is lacking but I'd still come back here. Maybe next summer we can eat on the large deck under the stars. :-)
