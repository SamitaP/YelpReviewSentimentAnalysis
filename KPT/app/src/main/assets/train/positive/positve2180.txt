You really drove by Fiori's said my cousin when I told him I picked up a pie from Campiti's.Would I get this pizza again?  Yes.Will I drive twenty minutes to get this pizza again?  NoI have to say this is a no frills pizza shop and my pizza was ready to go in 10 minutes both of which I appreciate.  The cheese sauce pepperoni and seasoning were delicious.  These three components are of equal quality and the sauce may be better than the pizza powerhouses around the city (Mineo's Fiori's Doughboy's Vincint's {while Vincent was still around}) but the crust is terrible.  I love the thinness and crunch of the crust but there is no doughy-ness to it at all.  My ideal crust is thin and rigid but once the surface is cracked when you fold it it has a little bit of dough in it.  This did not...I wouldn't say it was like a saltine but I would say it has frozen pizza qualities.I liked how it was served in a brown bag  (hate dealing with disposing of pizza boxes).  I also think the pizza reheat well which is an underrated but necessary component to pizzas.
