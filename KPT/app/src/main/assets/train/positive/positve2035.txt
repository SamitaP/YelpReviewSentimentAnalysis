Met some friends for breakfast.  We had 5 and there were no tables available on our arrival.  The hostess said we can have the table for 4 with someone seating in the window box just don't lean on the window... We said okey-dokey!  Waitress was quick and had coffee right away. She was fast with refills and any waitress that went by with the pot would check to see if we needed refills.  Had an omelet that is very large with veggies.  It was cooked perfectly and the veggies must have been put on the pan first to make sure they were warn and tender.  Potatoes were OK but nothing special. The table was crowded for five and just when the food was placed on our table one friend who said he could not make it showed up...Now a table for six.. Not really but the waitress did not blink and took that order quickly and that food arrived fast... Must have worked with the kitchen to get the order fast.  Thank you!  Was able to get a taste of the french toast and it was very good.  Someone in our group had the eggs benedict and said they were really good!When your done cross the street and go to Potomac Bakery and take some sweets home you'll be glad you did.
