My favorite local place in Shadyside.  My husband and I go for Friday HH (5-7 pm) every time we can.  Juan is great behind the bar but Fiona and Joe (I think Joe maybe his name is John?) are awesome as well.  The HH drinks change seasonally but you can always get your choice liquor mixed drinks also.  For $6/drink you can't beat it!We typically always get the hummus trio as an appetizer with extra pita bread or the calamari.  All of the entrees we have had (pork belly risotto pork chop) have been perfectly prepared zero complaints.  It's on a pricey side so not a weekly dinner option for us (unlike the HH!)I would say the complimentary valet is a perk but we live within walking distance so haven't used it.  TIP:  Go to HH on Fridays ask for Juan get a Manhattan.  Your QOL will improve greatly!
