I was neither particularly pleased nor dissatisfied with my lunch experience here... It was just meh. It's kinda pricey for what you get but the service is prompt and friendly and the music is fun and modern.They serve a mean crab bisque. It was deliciously creamy quite generous with the crab meat and very filling without that nasty sick after-feeling. The coconut shrimp (with a nice crunchy coconut-y breading) was also very tasty and the portion was satisfyingly large for an app! The house salad was just a typical salad of iceberg and romaine lettuce drenched in shredded cheddar cheese and sprinkled with a few other veggies. Nothing special.  Just a random quirk I noticed:  for being a rather classy restaurant I was surprised that they didn't add a slice of lemon to my glass of water (though I'm sure you could ask for it).  Would I recommend the place? Probably not but it was certainly not a bad experience! Just one that didn't stand out for the money you'll spend.
