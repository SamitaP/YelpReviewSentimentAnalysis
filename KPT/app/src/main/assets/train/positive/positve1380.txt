Most of the reviews we read called this place comfy or quaint which translates into a very small restaurant. It seems that the small size of the place ensures that every meal is attentively prepared because our food came out perfectly executed.My husband had a crab and salmon tartar appetizer while simply from reading reviews I walked in knowing what I wanted: goat cheese in puff pastry swimming in a shallow dish of creamy asian pear sauce. I literally wiped every bit of sauce off my plate with their bread.Which speaking of bread the Portuguese cornbread is to die for. I highly recommend buying a $2 loaf to take home and (as recommended by one of the waitresses) make yourself a few thick slices of french toast.For dinner my husband had duck with a Grand Marnier sauce and I had Cornish game hen in a butter wine tarragon sauce. Both were served with simply dressed cauliflower broccoli peppers and red potatoes. Again we ate every bit of food off our plates and sopped up the extra sauce with our bread.We did happen to order the two most expensive entrees on the menu and both had appetizers but I think $85 is absolutely reasonable for the high caliber food we received. Bring your own bottle of wine order the specials and take a loaf of bread home. We're sure happy that we did!
