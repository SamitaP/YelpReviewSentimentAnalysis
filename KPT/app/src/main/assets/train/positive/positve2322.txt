This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. They serve bar food but there's a nice variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. My favorite items on the menu are the veggie dogs pizza and soft pretzels. You can't beat their beer selection. Make sure to visit the beer cave while you are there and their section of take-out beer for an even larger selection.
