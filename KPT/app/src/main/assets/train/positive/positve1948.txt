Addicted to this place. What a unique burst of flavors when you bite into a slice of Beto's pizza. Cold cheese hot sauce and crunchy crust truly speak to my mouth's palate. I always find an excuse to stop her. Last time we had a steak hoagie too. It was big and full of flavor as well. It's no wonder they have been around for a long time. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE BETO'S. ~ Dionne Malush Pittsburgh Realtor
