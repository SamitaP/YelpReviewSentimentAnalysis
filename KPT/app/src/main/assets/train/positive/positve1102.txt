The food here was absolute perfection; each bite was perfectly orchestrated to deliver optimal flavor and enjoyment. The service was also fantastic!For my entree I had the cioppino -- it may be one of the best that I've ever had. The bowl was filled with beautiful looking seafood: large shrimp clams in their shells mussels in their shells a gorgeous piece of perfectly seasoned halibut and enormous wonderfully cooked scallops. They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well. And the charred sourdough served with the cioppino was the perfect complement to soak up all of the delicious savory flavors of the broth without becoming a soggy mush! My grandfather had the halibut and loved it... Cleaned the plate!I had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding so we had to share one for dessert! My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet smooth decadent indulgence that paired well with the house coffee.And the complementary salted caramels presented with the check were also amazing! I definitely need to come back again to try more of the menu... I think only wonderful items could possibly come out of that kitchen!
