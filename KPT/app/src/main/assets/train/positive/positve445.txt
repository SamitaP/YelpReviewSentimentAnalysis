I am writing this from the standpoint of someone who can't eat real Chinese food because of gluten issues. That said I am loving me some gluten-free Chinese food here! If the gf issue didn't exist though why bother when you can get real honest non-chain GREAT Chinese so many wonderful places in the Burgh?!  But average Chinese is better than NO Chinese if gluten is an issue so thank you Mr. Chang!
