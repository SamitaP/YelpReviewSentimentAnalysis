I find it hard to believe that a place like Triangle Bar and Grill only has 8 reviews.  I guess it's just not hipster enough for some people.  Which is fine with me.  I love walking in to this place.  It's never really crowded when I stop by on any given afternoon but they certainly have a steady stream of customers coming in for delicious sandwiches.  The crew behind the counter always greet me with a smile and are happy to make me a sandwich.  I have to admit that despite their many options I've only tried the Super Battleship a 2 foot Italian sub.  At only $14 it's quite a deal and great for parties.  It's packed with fresh meats and cheeses lettuce onion tomato and sprinkled with oil and vinegar and oregano.  Some might say it's the perfect sandwich.  It's definitely remained one of my favorites.
