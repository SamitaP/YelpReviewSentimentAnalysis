I love this place. My fiance and I moved to the Regent Square area in May and we've been to D's multiple times in the three or so months since. The food is good--fairly typical bar fare--but it's the beer that keeps bringing us back. Their selection is huge (see: beer cave) and I've had some amazing beers that I didn't know even existed. The employees really know their stuff and will help you pick a beer if you don't know what you want. My fiancee is not a huge beer fan but the bartenders/waitstaff have been successful in finding him something he likes. They also have at least three gluten-free beers for those with gluten sensitivities. The atmosphere is not too loud or crazy and is a nice place to go if you want to be able to hear your companions.The sad part is that D's closes fairly early--the bar closes at 11 on Sunday-Wednesday and midnight on Thursday-Saturday. The kitchen closes an hour before the bar.
