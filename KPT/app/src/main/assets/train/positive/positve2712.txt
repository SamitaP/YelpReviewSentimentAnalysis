The portions are Huge. I ordered half of the antipasto salad and it was still enough that I was satisfied. They should cut up the meat as it was slices of deli meat thrown into the salad though was a very good salad overall. I also ordered wings and was very impressed with these. It is hard to find the right wings that have the right amount of meat to breading mixture. They even make for a good treat on day 2. A friendly patron bought me a cannoli which was amazing. This was my second visit to Vincents and I look forward to a third.
