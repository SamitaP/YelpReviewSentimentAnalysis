As a former Regent Square resident and a current Point Breezer I can tell you that D's is a diamond in the rough.  Want an excellent hotdog?  How about a thousand beers to choose from?  Want to mix and match some beer and take it home to enjoy later?  Well you've found the money ball.  Your biggest challenge here is getting a good parking spot.  But don't give in you'll get a spot and you'll be happy you did. Don't like hotdogs you say?  Well they have delicious pizza too so whatever floats your boat you'll find it here.
