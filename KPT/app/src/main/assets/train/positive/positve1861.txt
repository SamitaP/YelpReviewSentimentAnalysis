I can't comment on how it is for actual meals but If you want food in the middle of the night you can't really be picky and they get the job done.  At first I thought the price on the strawberry pancake breakfast meal was high (around $9) but it comes with lots of food (3 big pancakes plus sausage & potatoes).  Nothing special compared to other pancake places but any stack of warm pancakes late at night is delicious to me.  The waitresses seemed nice and friendly especially considering it was past 2 AM and they have to deal with all the drunk people coming in.  Overall I liked it.
