PROS: Some of their plates are most definitely unique in terms of ingredients and flavor. Portions are great and flavor was really good.CONS: Desserts were average. Large portions but nothing special.PARKING: Challenging given you need to find street parking only.All-in-all I enjoyed the overall experience there in terms of service food quality and ambiance. I'd go back.
