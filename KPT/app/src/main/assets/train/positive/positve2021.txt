I assume lots of folks have seen this place featured on Food Network's Diners Drive-ins Dives. This place is exactly as it is on the show really tasty breakfast foods all made from scratch. Great family atmosphere with friendly staff.I had the apple cinnamon hotcakes and the cheese steak hoagie sandwich. The hotcakes were just awesome. They came as a stack of three hotcakes with a lump of butter and a squeeze bottle of syrup.The hoagie was just average kind of small with lettuce tomato green pepper seasoned with salad dressing and mayo. Kind of weird.Coffee wasn't very tasty either or rather seemed to be on the mild side.Note their hours are 6a - 3p. Metered street parking and a metered public lot down the block.
