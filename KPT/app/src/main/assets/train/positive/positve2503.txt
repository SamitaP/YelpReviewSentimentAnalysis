My first visit was tonight on wing night. I got barbecue wings and a side salad. My son got parmesan and garlic wings. Large meaty wings with flavorful coatings. I asked for ranch and blue cheese for dipping and both were delicious. The salad wasn't real special but it had a nice combination of greens. Waitress was friendly and efficient. Nice neighborhood feel. So glad my son brought me here. It was his 5th wing night visit on a row.
