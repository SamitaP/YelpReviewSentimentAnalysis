My friend Catherine came in from Chicago to visit me for the weekend. After a morning at the Aviary we stopped here for lunch before heading over to the Phipps Conservatory. I'd never tried this place before so I wanted to stop in. Catherine was hungry--she said she could have eaten cardboard at that moment and it still would have tasted good! Luckily she didn't have to go that route and the food here was much better than cardboard! We began our lunch by splitting an order of Angry Shrimp. Angry Shrimp is very spicy (as its name implies) and is served over chilled pasta. For my main course the Apple Raspberry Salad sure was tempting but my blood sugars were running high (I'm a type-1 diabetic) and I already had my carbs with the pasta. I wanted a burger as a second choice but their burgers are 1/2 pound and I knew I couldn't finish one. Plus I didn't want to schlep leftovers on the bus. So I opted for a Chicken Cobb Wrap which was tasty enough. For the life of me I can't remember what Catherine ordered but she did remark that the food was good. She tried the Penn Pilsner beer which she loved. I don't drink but unsweetened brewed ice tea with a little lemon in it really hit the spot. So the food here is good as is the service. But there doesn't seem to be anything that distinguishes this place from Chili's Houlihan's Mex & Erma's etc. And I wish they'd offer 1/4 lb burgers. Still it's a good place to go if you're visiting the nearby Aviary Science Center the Warhol or if you're going to a Steeler's or Pirate's game.
