I had not been to Betos in many many years.  Boy has the place grown up.  Still the same pizza that you will either love or hate.The Pizza here has the chesse and topings put on after they cook it so it melts some while you eat it.  Tastes really good.  I also has the apetizer sampler which was a lot of food for two people.Was not to crowded but full Saturday at lunch.Highly recommended.
