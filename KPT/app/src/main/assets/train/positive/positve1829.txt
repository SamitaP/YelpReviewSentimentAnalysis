The Huddle is foolishly cheap.  It's cash only.  You'll meet a lot of Yinzers here.  It's highly entertaining to sit at the bar and listen to the conversations occurring around you.  The average age is probably 45 but it's well interspersed with younger people hipsters and unpretentious people that want a cheap beer.  If you live in the area and you haven't been here yet you should definitely swing through.  Most bottles of beer here are $2.  Don't expect to order any micros but there's a solid list of macros available.  Buckets are a popular option.  I've also eaten here and while I don't remember what I got I do know that it was cheap and it was well worth the $6 or so I spent on the meal.  Last but definitely not least...there's free fresh popcorn in the back.  Boom.
