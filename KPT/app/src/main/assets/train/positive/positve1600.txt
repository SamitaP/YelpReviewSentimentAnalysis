Got take out from this place on the weekend.  Ordered kung pao chicken steamed dumplings and pork egg rolls.  I was really hungry so it hit the spot but there wasn't that many chicken pieces in my kung pao chicken - a lot of peanuts (as expected) and a whole lot of celery and carrots (aka filler).  So I was a bit disappointed in that.  The steam dumplings were good especially when fresh and hot.  The egg roll was tasty as well - I didn't find it too oily.  Very affordable and a generous portion - I had the leftovers the next day.
