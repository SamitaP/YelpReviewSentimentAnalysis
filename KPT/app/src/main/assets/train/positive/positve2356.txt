went here with a couple friends who live in Pittsburg for a quick drink.  Really cool atmosphere.  I got the run down as we sat about how it's a beer store and bar/grill all-in-one.  weird liquor laws i suppose.they had about 20-24 brews on tap.  went with the Terrapin Hopsecutioner which I've had before and really enjoy it.  They had a lot of local seasonals on tap but I had to drive and I was tired so I stuck to only one.Food was decent.  Typical bar/grill menu.  We ordered up some Pub Fries and Wings.  Decent nothing special but I wasn't expecting the world.  My friend got a Chicago dog that looked amazing.
