I was thoroughly impressed. I am not a vegetarian but I enjoyed the variety and uniqueness of food options here. I was not upset that I wasn't eating meat at all. I also had something called a root down which is root beer and espresso and it was heavenly. My only complaint is that it seemed to be a little pricey for the type of restaurant it is. Also you may have to be a young twenty something hipster/college student to enjoy it but I am a young twenty something so no complaints here.
