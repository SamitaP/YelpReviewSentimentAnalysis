Great breakfast and the pancakes are fantastic! A few downsides though. There's no free parking (meters available and a lot around the corner isn't enforced on Sundays) and there's always a wait. The wait for two hasn't been too bad for us- usually 15-20 minutes. Service is pretty good overall and it's definitely worth it!
