Recently went back to give Cain's another shot. Even though the service was bad the last time I was there the food was always good. I haven't given the dining room a second try yet but when I sat in the bar the service was actually good. The bartender was attentive and I never had a problem getting his attention if I needed anything. The food was good it was served fast and the portions were huge as usual. Although I am still a bit hesitant to sit in the dining room I will definitely go back again after this recent experience to at least sit in the bar area.
