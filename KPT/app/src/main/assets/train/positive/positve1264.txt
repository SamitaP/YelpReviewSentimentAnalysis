this is my go-to delivery place -- low minimum for free delivery they always get my order right and they always get here quick!  their gourmet pizzas are awesome (mediterranean greek and spinach and feta are my favorites).  their regular pepperoni pizza is also the best i've had in pittsburgh.  love their wing zings (breaded spicy wings) and steak and cheese hoagie too.  haven't tried their calzones or pasta yet.  pizza perfectta is sooo much better than pizza sola...pizza sola is so hit or miss.  and much friendlier/more competent people working here.
