My mom and I went here for dinner while visiting Pittsburgh. It is a pretty small building maybe about 15 tables total plus a bar. You can sit wherever you want. It's a casual bar type environment. Our waiter was friendly and prompt. We both ordered the pasta primavera with chicken. The portions are huge-- I have enough leftover for two more meals. The sauce was creamy and flavorful and there were enough veggies. The side salad was a bit lacking-- it's just iceberg lettuce (my mom says there seemed to be romaine too) with some olives and a couple grape tomatoes. They give you these awesome little garlic knots with the salad and entree. The dessert was the highlight. I ordered the homemade cannoli. It was a good size plenty to share between two people. Delicious crispy shell amazing ricotta filling with chocolate chips covered in powered sugar. It was just as good as the cannoli I'd had from an award-winning bakery in New York City!The prices are around what you'd pay at Olive Garden but the food here tastes homemade and fresh and the portions are large. Nothing pretentious about the place just good food!We drove past twice trying to first figure out where the restaurant is (from the address you think it's on the other side of the street) and then how to enter the parking lot. But we found a spot okay once we managed to get there.
