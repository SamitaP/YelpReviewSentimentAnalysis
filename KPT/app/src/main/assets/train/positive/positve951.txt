Excellent place for brunch.  For $22 I had a mimosa; cheese fruit and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin scone and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  Service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  Reservations available through Open Table.  This is definitely a special occasion brunch but it is surprisingly affordable.
