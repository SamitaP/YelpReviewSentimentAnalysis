The Huddle is like something out of my California-girl dreams where something called yinzers talk about awesome blue collar things in weird accents and you watch hockey and drink beer.It is so exotic! My husband a Pittsburgh native thinks of it as your classic neighborhood bar. But a place like this would be overrun with Hipsters in California and they'd charge 6 bux for a PBR. They have free popcorn which is amazing. And their food looks pretty good though I've never eaten here. Actually once I had cheese fries and they were pretty tasty huge plate for $4 I think it was. Great bar! Very comforting!
