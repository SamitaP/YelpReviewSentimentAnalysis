I really like SoHo.  First off it's located on the north shore and close to everything.  Nice bar friendly staff sleek and modern.  Great place to watch a game LCD screens everywhere.  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy but since it wasn't mine I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or if you're not feeling fancy just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place too.
