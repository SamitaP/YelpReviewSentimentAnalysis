Beto's is a love or hate place.  I love it.  Great crust lots of topping sauce with chunks of tomato.  If you want a classy place go somewhere else.  If you want high-end pizza then go somewhere else.  If you want good blue-collar pizza that is tasty and cheap this is the place.By default the toppings (cheese included) are thrown on after the fact and come out raw.  That's OK with me but if you add the magic word baked as in I'll have three cuts pepperoni baked they will put the toppings on and put the pizza back in the oven until it melts.  It is still awesome.the italian sub is also great.  Ask them to add pepperoni it's worth it.  I've been going there since 1994 and am indebted to the guy that took me there for lunch. If you think it is a dive now you should have seen it then.definitely worth a stop if you are doing a pizza tour of Pittsburgh.
