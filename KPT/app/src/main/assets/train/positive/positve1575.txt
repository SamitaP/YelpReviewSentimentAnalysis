Max's is great. It feels like your German grandmothers house and the service matches this feeling. The food is authentic and inexpensive. If you are not too familiar with German food just ask and the waitress will walk you though the favorites.I love the sausages and the stuffed pretzels are amazing but the Apple Fritter is the greatest thing ever.
