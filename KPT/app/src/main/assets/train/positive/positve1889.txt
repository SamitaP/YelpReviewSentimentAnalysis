This is my Man's favorite pizza place.  When he has visited Pittsburgh in the past without me he sends me picture messages of his slices.  On the plane ride coming into Pittsburgh last week all he could talk about was Beto's.  So when we landed we of course drove right over (after being awake all night on a red eye flight) so that I could taste all that is awesome in Beto's pizza slices.  It was very good.  We ordered the simple extra cheese pizza.  For those of you who are like me (from Oregon where I guess NO pizza is good) this pizza was hot crust sauce and minimal melted cheese with fresh cold mozzarella piled HIGH on top.  I have never had a slice of pizza put in front of me with so much cold cheese piled on it before.  I wasn't exactly sure how to eat it but figured it out and it was very good different but good.  I would take Beto's pizza over Oregon pizza any day.
