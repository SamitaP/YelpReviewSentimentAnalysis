Another lunch spot for the northshore.  This probably has the best food.  The french dip and the wraps are very good.  It's a tad pricey but not horrible.  They're really good for pickup.  As is a constant problem on the northshore service is INCREDIBLY slow.  You won't get out of here in under an hour if you dine in.  The waitresses are just MIA with refills and bringing checks and the food takes a while to come out too.  But if you have time to spend it's probably the best lunch spot on the north shore.  If you're running low on time - call ahead and grab it to go.
