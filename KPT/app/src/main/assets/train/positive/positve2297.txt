The hot dogs are somewhat disappointing and the beer is slightly overpriced but you come here for the sheer selection of those beers. An enormous beer cave makes one feel like a kid in a beer store. Unfortunately only their cheaper domestic/import selection is refrigerated which really sucks cause you can't drink those beers you find int he beer cave right away. Still if you're looking for selection this is the place.
