This place just plain had it all simple as that.  I saw the joint on Triple D and knew I wanted to check it out when I was in Pittsburgh for work.  Especially since it is known for breakfast which is my favorite meal!The Dor Stop is especially known for its pancakes and they have several to chose from.  After some contemplation I decided on the Pumpkin Pancakes.  And what a great decision it was!  They were amazing!  I put syrup on them because I'm a sugar whore but they honestly didn't need it!  They were big moist and perfectly sweetened all by themselves!  So tasty!  Another nice thing about the place is that it's not in Pittsburgh but rather in the Dormont area outside the 'Burg.  A rather quaint little area it was.  So get down there and check it out!  You won't be disappointed!
