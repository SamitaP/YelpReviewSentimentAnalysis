I somehow discovered this place when searching for sandwich places to enjoy with a friend.  How I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street not 10 minutes from my house I will never understand.  Maybe because the entrance is set back from the sidewalk a bit so it looks dark (i.e. possibly closed) when you first walk by.  Or maybe because it's overshadowed by the Isaly's next door.  Please I beg of you fellow Yelpers don't ignore this place any longer!Please note as other reviewers have that North Shore Deli is cash only.  But believe me you won't need much.  They do have a website that really just lists the sandwiches they offer and their hours or see my photo of the menu board showing the sandwiches available (all named after local streets).  It was difficult to decide on just one sandwich.  But after reading the few reviews here I decided to go with the hot sausage.  When I first arrived the meat was still cooking.  I didn't mind I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet treats for later.  When I returned I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly small talk ensued.  I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well.  When I got home and unwrapped my sandwich I was surprised by the hot sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends.  And that it was my friends.  Exploding with flavor that is.  The ends were crispy and delicious and the sausage was just hot enough that the macaroni salad was the perfect cool salad compliment.  I guarantee you this is only the first of many visits.
