Now this is the Atria's I remember.I have been coming to this location since PNC Park opened. In the beginning everything was great. Great food and outstanding service. Then everything went down hill. The most popular items were taken off the menu. The portions were cut down and the quality of the food when down with it. Service was horrible as well. We stopped going for years because by that time Pittsburgh was in a restaurant boom. The Cheesecake Factory McCormick & Schmick's and a lot of other similar restaurants had opened.I recently started going back to Atria's when a co worker decided to treat me to lunch since it's near my office. The great food and service is back! The burgers are excellent! I highly recommend the crab cakes they are second best behind Monterey Bay. I love the Sherry Crab Bisque and the Pot Roast Nachos appetizer are a must try! I just went for a Christmas work lunch and everything was perfect. We had ten people and everyone loved their food. Everyone got something different burgers steaks seafood salads and sandwiches. The service was excellent. All of our glasses were refilled constantly before they ever got even half way empty.The Atria's I know and love is back!
