Three stars is super accurate for this place. We decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken BUBBA SHOW (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) Our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. All together like $13 for three people which is pretty good. As for the pizza the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin and the sauce was sweet not seasoned. I prefer a more herby sauce myself so I wasn't wowed by it. The fries were a bit soggy but tasty. Overall if I were in a pinch I'd order from here no problem but it's not a place I'd set out to order from because I love it.
