I enjoyed my evening experience here last night. The bar was really busy but service was still fast. They only serve beer and wine downstairs. If you want a mixed drink you have to go upstairs. We ordered a large supreme pizza and it was really good! The wait staff was super nice!! Would definitely grab food and drinks here again
