33 beers on tap good food and most the bartenders are awesome. I had a chance to talk to the guy who orders all the beers and he was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They have a ton of TV's which makes it nice as you can watch the games no matter where you are and that's a plus as weekend nights get packed. Yuengs on special all day Saturday and Craft specials on Tuesday are really nice. From what I've seen it's usually a mixed crowd of older regulars and the younger crowd and everyone seems to get along.
