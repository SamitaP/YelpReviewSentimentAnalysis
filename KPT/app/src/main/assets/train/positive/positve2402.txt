Beer and Dogs.  This isn't your ballgame 7 dollar Miller Lite and generic hotdog either.  This is 7 dollar Chimay and a loaded Chicago style dog heaven.  A lengthy review of a place that relies entirely on beer and hot dogs would be redundant so I'll keep this short.Great atmosphere Decent enough staff Fair prices BEST beer list anywhere I've ever been!  If they don't have something you want on draft chances are you can find it in their beer cave.  And the hot dogs and fries are always atop the City's Best.If that isn't enough to get you stop by D's then you're missing the point and probably shouldn't anyhow.
