I hadn't been to Cain's in a few months but re-visited the establishment last evening for a quick happy hour.  I was very impressed with interior revision.  It went from old school boring bar to upscale neighborhood bar.  The beer selection is ideal and the new tap wall keeps it simple.  Southern Tier IPA is amazing!  And you can walk out of the place not smelling like smoke.  I will return...
