Rated one of Pittsburgh's best in 2012 I was excited to enter Legends and prepare for  what was sure to be an amazing meal. Upon entering Legends you get the immediate hole in the wall vibe (a vibe that I love) with diner style tables and chairs. We started with the margarita bruschetta. This was delicious increasing my already high expectations. Our waitress came back- I ordered the Penne Vodka and was excited but overwhelmingly disappointed. The sauce although good is simply ordinary. I've been to countless Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh and could name at least 20 better than Legends.  Had Legends not received substantial praise I may have not been so disappointed but when you're touted as one of the best I expect nothing short. To their benefit the restaurant is BYOB maybe this gets so much praise because everyone's drunk before their meal is served...Food C+ Service B-
