Four stars for the pizza!Great crust.  I usually don't eat the crust but I couldn't let this go to waste.  We ordered the Leopold.  In the description it noted a hint of anchovy.  It ended up being more than a hint which was welcomed by my boyfriend and myself.  We'll be back when we're in the area.  I see this being a regular spot after our rounds of golf at Mt. Lebanon GC.
