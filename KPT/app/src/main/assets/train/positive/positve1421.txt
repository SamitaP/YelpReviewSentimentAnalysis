Might be the best restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh! Made reservations on a Friday evening at 9:00PM for two.Apps: The service was great the server knew all menu items in detail by heart. We started with 2 appetizers my fiance wanted the Calamari and Shrimp that was in a garlic herb lemon sauce...best shrimp I have ever had they were colossal! I ordered the Meatball stuffed with bufala mozzarella smothered in a plum tomato sauce it was unbelievable! The salads course was great and I'm not a salad guy. We were both almost full at this point and we still had the pasta and entree course ahead.The Pasta Course: The owner wheels out a cart to our table with a whole wheel of Locatelli Pecorino Romano in which he will use to make our Cacio e Pepe table side. He pours 2 portions of linguini on top of the cheese wheel adding the heavy cream EVOO and pepper he mixes and digs into the top layer of the cheese wheel and serves it into our bowls.Entrees: I ordered the Veal Chop Milanese I was so full at this point I took 2 bites out of my Veal and couldn't go anymore but this was the best veal chop I have ever had had to take the rest home. My Fianc√© she ordered the Chilean Sea Bass but was equally as full the fish was perfectly prepared and melted in your mouth she took all but 2 bites home also. Unbelievable experience!!
