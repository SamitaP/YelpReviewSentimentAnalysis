The co-op is great!  When we had to put our children on a diet free of gluten and dairy we were lost -- until we found the East End Food Co-op. That was 10 years ago and I've shopped there weekly ever since. It provides for all of our gluten-free dairy-free needs - and even allows the opportunity to purchase in bulk as a member. I also love buying grains beans etc. from the bulk bins fair trade products and many daily food items like cereals nut butters snacks etc. They now stock meat/poultry from local farms and specialize in Vegan options. Also have to mention the awesome produce section stocked mostly from local farms.
