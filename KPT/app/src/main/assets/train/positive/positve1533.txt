I have been going to Max's for 20 years.  I love this place.  The Einlauf soup is just simple good eats but if you're ever there when the soup special is beer cheese - ORDER IT!!.  I love their potato pancakes sauerbraten and the basket of German rolls served with sauerkraut salad and apple butter.  The waitresses have been there for years they are the best!  Most delicious long island iced tea in the city.
