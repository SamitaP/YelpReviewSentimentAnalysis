BEST SUBS EVER.  Seriously.  We saw this on PA n'at with Dave and Dave and it looks awesome.  We took the drive to Swissvale and got us a Battleship and it was literally 3 feet long just the right amount of veggies and meat and delicious.  It was 2 meals worth of food (for two people).  Even better the next day.  And the best part was that it was under 13 bucks.  It's great fast food.  I can't wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of 40s along with a Battleship.
