Visited Max's last Friday night with friends who'd come in from out of town. As another reviewer described the whole experience was 'tired'. Service was very good however. I was hoping for a more colorful fresh decor but everything looks aged and washed out. I just got a very 'blah' vibe as we walked back to our table and it really had a bad impact on my appetite and perception. I had the Wurst Sampler Platter and it was okay. The potato pancakes were dull...I don't think there was any salt in them. The cheese-stuffed pretzels were very good!The following day was the 2nd annual Deutschtown Music Festival. The neighborhood is working toward revitalization and I hope local businesses like Max's will step up their game. I believe the investment will be worth it.
