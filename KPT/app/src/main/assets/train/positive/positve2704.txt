The inside of Vincent's has the distinct smell of wall-to-wall carpets and fried food - not necessarily 'bad' but certainly pungent.  I'm glad we came here on a nice afternoon when the deck was open.  We split fried zucchini which was delicious sliced really thin with homemade marinara for dipping.  I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and my dining companion got the italian calzone.  Both were good - fresh ingredients and lots of them.  The portions were absolutely huge.  Overall the service was fine - no major issues.  Good place for casual dining and good bar food.
