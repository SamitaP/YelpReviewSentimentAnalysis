Recently realized that I have been a customer of Rudy's for 40 years. When I was a kid we got Sicilian-style pizza from his previous location on Washington St. in Swissvale. Then when they moved and became a sub shop I got hooked on those wonderful cheesesteaks. Now I live over 15 miles away and still head over there from time to time for my cheesesteak fix.Now to be clear this is probably not a place your typical Yelper would like. There is no ambiance. No decor. No table service. No boutique brands of soda. Nothing on the menu is infused. You'll probably want to get your sandwich to go.But if you want a delicious cheesesteak I don't know why you would want to go anywhere else. The two best hoagie places in the area are less than a half-mile apart on the same street  - Rudy's and the Triangle bar.
