Some of my favorite pizza on the planet. If you haven't had it remember it is unique don't walk in expecting 'factory' pizza. It is square cut and the cheese is put on after the crust and sauce are cooked. MONEY!If you are taking it out get the cheese on the side we even get 'extra cheese' a lot of the time.Toppings: most toppings on the pizza are put on after it is cooked also. I usually go straight cheese ( not a fan of cold pep or mushrooms) The sause is old school nothing fancy but darn good nice chunks of tomatos in the sauce.  If your in town worth the experience if you live near by...lucky you!
