One of the best hole in the wall bbq places you might find. Prices are pretty reasonable. Bring Cash. Small plate for $7something will get you about 5 huge ribs. It comes with bread too. A large plate is 10 and it is probably huge.  They tend to be packed on the weekend but its a god place to get it and go. warning- you might get messy. The collard greens are amazing as well. They have sweet potatoe pie from time to time... if you are going to the Mattress Factory - make this your after stop!
