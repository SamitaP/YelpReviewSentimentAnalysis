NOTE :  They have moved further North along Banksville Road to the basement of the Days Inn (where Maharaja was for years and then more recently Billu's Grill(now closed obviously.)It's all of the renovations/new furnishings that Billu's put in (Maharaja was circa 1978-esque decor/furnishings.)I tried it today .  Food was better  somehow than it ever was at the prior location .Very friendly/accomodating staff  .  More centrally-located now .
