I stopped by Bado's on a recent Wednesday for an early dinner with a friend. When I first walked in I was rather surprised at the decor. The way Bado's is talked about and with this prime location I imagined it to be more modern. I was wrong. Inside it is your typical neighborhood pizza place/bar. Clean well maintained but nothing shiny or fancy here. Looking over the menu I noticed some classics and some distinct choices. Sandwiches soups salads pizzas and calzones. Some with toppings/fillings you would not expect. Feeling unadventurous we decided to order their (famous) wedding soup a cheese pizza and a sausage calzone to be able to try a few of the classics. The soup came out first. The meatballs were tasty but otherwise I'm not sure why it would be famous. It definitely did not stand out to me. Another item that did not stand out the pizza. I was looking for something more. The pizza sauce was a bit tart for me. The real winner of the meal was the sausage calzone (which we added ricotta to). The sausage had a great spice to it. The heat was nicely complimented by the creamy cheese and crisp crust. Overall good food for a neighborhood bar.
