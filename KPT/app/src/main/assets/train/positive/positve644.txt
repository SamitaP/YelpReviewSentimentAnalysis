We ordered from here because Uncle Chen our go-to takeout place down the road was closed. I ordered the General Tso tofu a favorite dish of mine and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude per se but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone so if you're like me and never carry cash you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.The food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away) it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection perfect-sized pieces of tofu and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal paired with some mediocre egg rolls.So long story short lady on the phone was a bit irritating delivery was fast food was fresh and depending on what you order the food quality ranges from so-so to great. If you're looking for a quick fix to your Chinese food craving this is a good place to order from although I'll be going back to Uncle Chen before I try China Sea again.
