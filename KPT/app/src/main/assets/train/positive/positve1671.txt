I go to this place about once a month for lunch and I am consistently impressed with the quality of my meals and the service. It seems like an unassuming cafe but the food is way above average and the waitstaff is always friendly and engaging.Usually I will get one of their sandwiches and I am especially impressed with their chicken parmesan panini. It's obvious that the ingredients are fresh and the bread is homemade. It's the kind of meal I would expect in an New York bistro but it is right here in Pittsburgh. Overall this is a great restaurant if you like fresh ingredients and good Italian food. Also the conversation with the waitstaff is always so fun!
