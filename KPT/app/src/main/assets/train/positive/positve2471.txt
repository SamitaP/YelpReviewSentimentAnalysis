Pleasantly surprised by the extent of the selection of beer here. Also -- I'm visiting from Seattle and they have Elysian on tap! Elysian Night Owl is the best pumpkin variety I have ever had in my life. Came here with my aunt Joanne and she really couldn't believe that as a beer enthusiast I had never been here. Try the Elysian!
