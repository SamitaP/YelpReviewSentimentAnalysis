While visiting the Pittsburgh area my wife and I were intrigued by the excellent reviews we found of Alla Familgia.  While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township we needed a dining reprieve after a disappointing visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.  East Warrington Avenue is undergoing major construction which made finding parking a bit difficult fortunately there is valet service in a lot to the side of the restaurant which we took advantage of.  Upon entering we were warmly welcomed by the host.  We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather which enabled us to get a table.  I strongly advise to get reservations in advance.  We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  Awesome.All that has been said in prior reviews I heartily agree with.  The bread cheese and dipping oil was a delicious start.  Ingredients were fresh.  The pasta and main course dishes were done perfectly.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Filet Mignon which she described as one of the best meals she has ever eaten.When we are in the area we'll be back.
