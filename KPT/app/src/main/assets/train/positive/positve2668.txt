I love this Bruegger's! It's like the others in the chain so you probably either like their food or you don't. (But who doesn't like bagels?) But I find this particular Bruegger's to be exceptional. The staff is always kind and attentive and I'm in love with their tomato caprese bagel sandwich. They're convenient and delicious - what more can I say or ask for?
