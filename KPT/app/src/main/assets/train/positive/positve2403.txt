Just made my yearly pilgrimage to D's after my eye exam across the street.  Great Taps (local offerings and belgian style) with Chicago style hotdogs what more do you need to know!...Waiter made some excellent beer suggestions and I rarely stray from the off the rack Chicago dog but his suggestion to add the bacon was spot on.  No trip is complete without visiting the beer cave.  Some hard to get gems can be had.  Many of the choices can be found at Giant Eagle now for less.  Their selection of Mikkeller offerings was an unexpected bonus.  Walked out of their with some great hard to find titles...see you guys next year!....
