Blah blah blah cold toppings piled high cheese yinzer childhoods etc. Beto's gets three stars because it is inconsistent - and they themselves admit it. I've had pizza from here that is outright bad I've also had pizza here which nudged against my all time top pizzas list. Usually there will be a cycle for me where I will have a really good slice and convince myself I have to go back there - sometimes in the same week. Then I'll have a bad slice and forget about it for months maybe even years. Then I'll be in the area again and the cycle will continue. The cold cheese doesn't bug me because you get so much (portion size here is far beyond ample. $1.25 for each slice - 4 is well beyond my maximum - gets you about a 1/3 of a bag of mozzarella an extra $.50 will get you as much of whatever topping you feel like having). If you get take-out it'll pretty much melt by the time you get home if you leave the box shut. One thing to note - this is my favorite place to get black olives on a pizza since they don't go into the oven.
