Any place where I can crack up cut up let my hair down and be loose is a place I love to be. It's a diner  kinda of self explanatory seeing as to how that's part of the name.  So they have your typical dinner fare breakfast items sandwichs CHICKEN TENDERS.  You get it I don't need to explain a diner to you.  Don't judge me I'm usually wasted upon arrival to Tom's Diner it's not a place where I plan on ending up just a place that I manage to get lol.Anyhow the pancakes are good and the wait staff is down to earth and very tolerant. In my opinion it's not worth a trip across town but with friends in Dormont it's a sure stop if I'm visiting over that way. Enjoy!
