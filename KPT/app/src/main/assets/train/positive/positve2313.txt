In my final meal in Pittsburgh I finally had the closest thing to a Pittsburgh sandwich and that was the Big Ben Hot Dog with cole slaw fries and a cheese sauce. It oddly worked and I enjoyed the meal before I had to hit the road. The fries our table shared was also a winner as they were crispy and uniformly cut and fluffy potato goodness in the middle. Definitely a great cheap eats spot.
