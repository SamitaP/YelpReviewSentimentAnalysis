They don't deliver to me anymore moved to Lawrenceville.  However their pizza is good not too greasy not too dry.  Nice balance with the sauce cheese and toppings.  They have awesome house rolls I'm partial to the spinache and feta house rolls.  They are SO delicious.  Pretty cheap.  The delivery time is kind of long but they are open late and I love that.
