I was recently in North Side apartment shopping and decided to swing in and check out this nice little cafe on the corner. I'll admit I was pleasantly surprised. Small little place but great environment sociable servers and above average Italian cuisine. I wouldn't say it was the best or most authentic Italian I've had (my being a chef bias aside) but far far from the worst. The environment and location are what makes this tiny little cafe a nice little gem. The food could use some fine tuning as far as seasoning and execution but the presentation is on point. If you're over on North Side need a quick bite or an espresso break I'd highly recommend swinging in and giving this place a shot.
