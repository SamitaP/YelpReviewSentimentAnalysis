I have been to this place many many times over the years. But the last visit was at least a year prior. I was shocked by the outside condition of the restaurant. This place definitely looks like it's falling apart on the outside. I didn't stay there to eat but from what little that I  saw the inside looked fine. My toasted bagel with cream cheese was okay but there wasn't a napkin in the bag. Seems like a silly oversight.
