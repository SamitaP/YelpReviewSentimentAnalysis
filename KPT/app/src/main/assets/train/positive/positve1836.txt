Sushi Three is located in a strip of shops on Beverly Road alongside a coffee shop florist several banks and two pizza places.  This and Little Tokyo are to my knowledge the only sushi restaurants in Mt. Lebanon.Sushi Three has an extensive menu that seems to have expanded since the last time I visited and has lots more than just sushi.  There is a long list of appetizers tempuras and teriyaki dishes and some Chinese offerings.  The main focus the sushi takes up a large portion of the menu and there are many different rolls ranging from the basic kappa rolls to the complex southside roll (shrimp smoked eel fish flakes cucumber spinach mushrooms egg and caviar).  As a vegetarian I appreciate the vegetable sushi platter which I have never seen anywhere else and only costs $12.  There is even a separate vegetarian menu.While I do appreciate the wide-ranging menu I just can't like the atmosphere.  It's always very quiet and dark inside and I always get the feeling of being in a cave.  I prefer to get take-out or delivery.Overall I prefer Little Tokyo but with Sushi Three's improved menu and large number of vegetarian options my rating may change soon.
