I thought the food was absolutely delicious and fresh. Our hibachi chef Hoy was fantastic! I ordered tofu and veggies (asparagus broccoli onion snow peas) for me everything was prepared to perfection. We didn't get a show but we had really good conversation throughout our lunch.Our server was in his words still waking up and not on top of his game at all he forgot to put in my boyfriends extra fried rice and something for the guests we were seated with. When the server doesn't put in an order the kitchen doesn't put it on the cart and when your chef gets to the grill he doesn't have everything he needs and everything gets held up. I left with a big happy belly which is not usually the case when I eat hibachi and everyone else in my party was just as pleased!Fun fact: Benihana is no longer able to pop food in your mouth because someone (in Florida I believe) got a hot shrimp to the eye and sued the company.
