This is hands down the best italian restaurant in the city.  Chef Dan makes you feel at home in this cozy little restaurant.  The open kitchen is very entertaining.  I usually get one of the specials as I have worked my way through most of the menu.  Every dish is better than the last.   The Antipasto appetizer is always a good choice.
