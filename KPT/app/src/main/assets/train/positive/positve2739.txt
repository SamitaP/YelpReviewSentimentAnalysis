well it's Olive Garden... nuf said! Who doesn't love olive garden??? I think maybe once or twice in my life have I bothered to get an entr√©e. I prefer just getting a drink and chowing down on salad and bread sticks. I was so happy when this location opened up. It meant we didn't have to trek all the way to greentree. Now i'm back in Spain... I could really use an Olive Garden here!
