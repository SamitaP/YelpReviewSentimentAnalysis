I honestly can't get enough of this place.  We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right up the road.  Now its one of my favorite places to go out with my friends.Its a bit pricey (~$15/person) but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.Now to the food:The bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.The sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite though is the schnitzel liechtenstein with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic or German/Bavarian food or just trying new stuff.  It's awesome.
