Eh been here a few times since moving to Dormont. It's just okay. I've been to many Eat n' Park restaurants around Pittsburgh and this one is nothing special.A royal pain to park at and the food is just mediocre. People are nice though and have no complaints about the service. I would come here after hitting up the bars or for dessert one night but that's about it. Banksville location is much better in my opinion.
