My friend and I were having a weekend trip to Pittsburgh (first time!) and stopped in for brunch on Sunday before our visit to the nearby Pittsburgh Glass Center. We weren't familiar with the area & this looked like a cute place- ended up definitely enjoying our time here!We weren't aware that it was a vegan place; regardless the drinks menu & and the brunch menu both looked amazing. Friend ordered the Nyam which she said was very filling (surprisingly). I had the the Country burrito which definitely surpassed my expectations. Decent good. Friend & I both ordered the Don Juan mocktail which was the highlight of the meal- holy crap! AMAZINGLY GOOD- I always think that horchata tastes a little too watery but the coconut juice & caramel helps round out the drink & make my tastebuds sing. I'm only sad that I can't keep visiting and trying more of their drinks. Might not necessarily go out of my way to come back BUT I would definitely go again if I were in the area. :)
