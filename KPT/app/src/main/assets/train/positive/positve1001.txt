OH MAN! My boyfriend and I came here after having a wonderful experience at Soba Lounge. Big Burrito Group does it again.Casbah prints their menu daily so some of their dishes you see online won't be offered that day. You'll still find something delicious though.We thought the place looked kind of shoddy when we saw the front of it but it turns out they pitch up a tent-house in front of the actual restaurant to make their usual outdoor seating into additional seating during the wretched Pittsburgh winter.Our bread came with a walnut pecorino pesto and it was AMAZING. We were kind of disappointed that they only gave us 4 slices but the food we had ordered came out so quickly afterwards that we barely had time to mope about it.I ordered the long island duck with chestnut spaetzle brussels sprouts sage apples and cherries. The tanginess of the cherry and mild fruitiness of the apple was an amazing complement with the rich meatiness of the duck jus. I didn't think there was enough sauce but both the duck breast and duck leg were so tender I didn't care. I ended up almost finishing the entire plate even though the serving size was considerably large. All of that for under $30. My boyfriend got the lamb shank which was a super simple dish (lamb with mashed potatoes) that they managed to make out of this world. Super tender with a generous amount of lamb jus swimming around the plate. For dessert please get the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It takes a while for it to come out because they bake it on the spot. The 10 minute wait is so worth it. There are huge chunks of super dark chocolate and fresh raspberries in the fluffiest bread pudding I've ever had. Just remember not to burn yourself on the plate like I did. The meal ended with complimentary salted caramel. Don't put the whole thing in your mouth like I did.
