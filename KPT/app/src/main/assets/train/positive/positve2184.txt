Looking for cozy decor a fun atmosphere and friendly service? Don't come here.Looking for a fantastic pizza served fast and for relative cheap? Look nowhere else.Campiti's is a hole-in-the-wall formica countered 70's-paneled Pepsi menu board behind the cash register kind of place. There's not much seating the t.v. is a tiny tube job from the 80's and your pie comes on a piece of cardboard wrapped in a paper bag. And the service? Well they're efficient. They don't care if you like them they just want to get you your food and fast. But who cares? The reason I make it a personal mission to go to Camps every time I return to Pittsburgh is the pie. It's thin and crisp yet solid. Nice browning all over. The sauce is a well-seasoned red gravy that provides a tasty base for the copious amounts of mozzarella and whatever other toppings you want. Me I go for the pepperoni - which is the type that cups up in the oven forming little pools of fat - and anchovies. It's spectacular and reasonably priced. It is honest-to-god my favorite pizza place.Worth the trip to the South Hills wherever you start in Allegheny County.
