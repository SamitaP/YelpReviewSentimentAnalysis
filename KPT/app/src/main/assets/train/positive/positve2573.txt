I swore that Kobe Japanese Steakhouse in Orlando was the best one I had ever been to but I think they may have some competition with this one.My boyfriend and I tried them out on Labor Day just get something different from what we normally do. He had been some years back before and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know is that considered a mountain or is it a hill? Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legs/feet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome especially the raised bar.Our chef walks up and it's a white man which was a definite first for me at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out of it. During the course of the meal he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day what're gonna do? It didn't bother me too much but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.The food: oh man was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce but it didn't taste like it at all to me which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan. After eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere. Sure Japanese Steakhouses are pricey but this is one of the few I've been to that is more than worth it.
