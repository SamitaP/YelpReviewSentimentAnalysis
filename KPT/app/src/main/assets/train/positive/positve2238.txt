When you find a consistent restaurant with good food near your home you tend to visit that restaurant a lot. For me my fallback can't miss restaurant is Bado's. First off the menu is huge- pizza hoagies pasta sandwiches big burgers Boarshead hotdogs and huge apps. Everything I have tried there so far has been above average except maybe their lasagna which I found to be watery and tasteless. If you get a salad make sure you try their house dressing. It's their own vinaigrette that comes in a Grolsh bottle and is by far one of the best dressings I've ever had. Make sure you try it on the giant antipasti salad (which you should split with someone) and pair that with one of their calzones (my favorite is the reuben calzone but the meatball is excellent as well). Their pizza buffet is also good if you want to try a lot of different toppings. If you're looking for a good beer Bado's has a great selection of craft and microbrews on their huge board and the choices are always changing.You will also want to come to Bado's on weekend mornings for their breakfast. The omelets are huge and they have tons of toppings to choose from and the rest of their breakfast choices are above average. Even the coffee is good!The drawbacks to Bado's are that they're almost always busy and tables are a little cramped. Expect to wait a few minutes when you get there and don't expect stellar service. The wait staff is good but they're always busy so you'll probably be waiting for a refill. Also I like to have fries with my sandwich or burger and while their fries are pretty good they don't have them as a side. You have to order off their appetizer menu and the order is too big for one person and pricey.
