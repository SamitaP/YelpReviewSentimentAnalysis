Driving back from here right now. Great first experience. I'm not really a huge hot dog guy either. I eat them twice a year: Memorial and Labor Day. However the hot dogs were really good. I got the chicago beef dog. Wasn't a huge fan of the relish (don't really like sweet with savory) but I gave it shot. Friend got a custom turkey dog. He said the colesaw was great as was the entire hot dog. We also split small chili cheese fries. They were fantastic. Fries were crispy. Service was fast.Great selection of beer. I got the Seamus red ale. The beer cave is awesome. Beware of the yellow mustard though. After several washings my hands are still dyed yellow.
