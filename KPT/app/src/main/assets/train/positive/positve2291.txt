Love the BEER CAVE - would make any beer-neanderthal happy! Sorta like grabbing a cold one out of your friend's fridge except D's has a giant selection.The servers were pretty friendly even when it was last call. I can't say the food was so great but the beer options and good prices help to make up for it. This seems like an easy-going neighborhood bar and I bet it's even nicer when the garage door window is open during the warmer months.
