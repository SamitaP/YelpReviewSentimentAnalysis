Decent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus. The sauce and cheese are perfect but the crust falls short.  It has a nice texture and overall the pizza isn't greasy but the crust lacks much flavor. Maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate? The pizza is decent enough though and merits a try perhaps it was an off day for Eddies.
