its your typical run of the mill Chinese take out...but i must say between 3 moves around the immediate south and a name change (theyre now ABC Garden) i've stuck with these guys. never had a disappointing encounter with them even with the constant delivery staff changes. Their all day combos have a huge amount of food and theyre only about $8. Also I prefer my lo mein with sauce only and they don't have any problems accommodating. anyone else i order from always seems to have an issue and gives me the gross vegetables too. these little points along with quick delivery makes them my go-to when i need a quick noodle fix.
