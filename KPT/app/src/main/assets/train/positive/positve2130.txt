BEST BREAKFAST I'VE EVER HAD!!! I had the Guy's Version of the Jumblot. My girlfriend had the chocolate chip banana pancakes. These were the best pancakes I've ever eaten. They have a texture and gooeyness that I've never had in a pancake. The Guy's Version was eggs potatoes jalape√±os tomato cheddar and hot sausage. The hot sausage had the most amazing flavor. Everyone should definitely make a trip here once! Pancakes are to die for!!
