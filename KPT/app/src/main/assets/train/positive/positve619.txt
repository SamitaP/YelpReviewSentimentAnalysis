My fianc√©e and I have made R&B's our Friday night dinner tradition for over a year. the food is consistently amazing and portions are HUGE. Whether you choose to pick up or have it delivered it's always less then 30 minutes - and can we take a second to acknowledge the staff? Always exceedingly friendly and happy to accommodate any special requests. Sadly we're moving out of the area in two weeks so we won't be able to continue our tradition. But if you haven't given them a try do it! (might I suggest the Buffalo Chicken sub and the cheese and bacon fries? epic!)
