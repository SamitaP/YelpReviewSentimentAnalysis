My husband made us reservations here to celebrate our 5th anniversary and I am confident in saying that it was the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy and not stuffy at all which is not often the case with fine dining.  I appreciated the home-like feeling and the framed Pens jerseys on the wall! I am becoming a Yinzer...The bread and holy oil chickpea dish and goat cheese spread that they set the table with was amazingly good and it only gets better.  All their meals come with a salad and a pasta dish with vodka sauce.  (I didn't see anything about fettucine in a cheese wheel so maybe they don't do that anymore--not sure.)I ordered seafood diavolo but could only finish about 1/3 of it and my husband ordered a steak dish that he (amazingly) polished off.  He said it was the best steak he's had since we left Nebraska so that's a pretty high compliment.Yes this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree) but you can DEFINITELY get at least two meals from one and there is an option to share a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish which may be the route I would take in the future since I'm a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.I think everyone in the 'burgh should try this place at least once for a special occasion dinner because it's awesome!
