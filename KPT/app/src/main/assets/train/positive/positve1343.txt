Love the East End Food Co op .  Reasonably priced organic selections.  The smoothie/juice bar is outstanding.  Great vegan/and or healthy selections at the hot and cold salad bar.  My most favorite thing here is the ability to purchase raw unpasteurized unhomogenized milk.   The staff is very friendly the. produce is very fresh.  This is definitely a good way to avoid the over priced over processed major grocery chain food selection.  I love the co op.
