Better than expected. Great service. Had muscles red pepper pasta (forget the name) with scallops and lump crab husband had duck. Everything was cooked perfectly.  Waiter said he lived in many parts of the country and this was the best duck he's ever had and he was right. Only downfall is I didn't save room for s'mores dessert!
