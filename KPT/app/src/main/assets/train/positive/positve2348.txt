Enter into D's (after figuring out the correct door - I still make this mistake) and you'll be greeted by a long draft bar. For Chrissakes they have Delirium on tap! The real jewel though is in the back. You have the beer cave with hundreds of different types of cold beers for carry out or you can build your own six pack from the unchilled beers and chill them on the spot. D's is still the only place I've ever found the elusive Hopfenweisen by SchneiderWeiss and Brooklyn Brewery perhaps the best beer I've ever had.While D's is worth it for the beer alone the food's not bad either. The pizza is average but they truly do have the best hot dogs in the city.Finally bring a growler or buy one of theirs. Prices are reasonable and the selection is outstanding.
