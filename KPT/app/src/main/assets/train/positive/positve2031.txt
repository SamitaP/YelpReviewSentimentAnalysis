After remembering seeing the Dor-Stop on Diners Drive-ins and Dives we stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning at around 10AM.  Beating the brunch rush was great.  We had a short wait but were seated quickly.  Service was friendly if a bit rushed.  My omelette was tasty as were the accompanying home fries.  Everything was fresh and well-prepared.  I would return and it's the kind of local joint I'll look forward to bringing out-of-town guests to.
