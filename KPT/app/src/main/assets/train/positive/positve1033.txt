Hey do I really need to review this place? Look at the previous reviews but I will let you know that they have a great lunch deal the piccolo gusto menu. I highly recommend it because it is a heck of a deal and you can have tastes of a few different items so it pairs well with my self diagnosis of A.D.D. no offense to anyone who has A.D.D but it definitely kept my attention throughout my lunch experience. First off the service was excellent very attentive server who was really a foodie which I really appreciated. She knew a heck of a lot about the seemingly simple dishes I had ordered. The Piccolo Forno allows for a choice of Salad or soup a pasta or risotto half sandwich. I went with a taste of the Pea Tendrils and Frisee Salad while slightly complex to eat it had a savory flavor from the light dressing and blue cheese crumbles then I went with cauliflower risotto which was riculous. That is how you make risotto people. For the half samich I went with the half turkey. The turkey wasn't just a normal turkey slice from the deli counter this was actually very nicely trimmed meat off of a bird that was prepared in house and it was immediately noticeable. All this for $15 dollars I'll take it....And I'll do it again many times over again. Come here for lunch sometime and check it for yourself.
