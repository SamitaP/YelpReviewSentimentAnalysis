Even though they were out of the first beers we asked for (the Dogfish Punkin) this place hit the spot for a junk food craving. Vegetarians: the veggie dog is awesome not rubbery or pale but nearly mistakable for an actual hot dog. I ordered one with kraut and mustard and my boyfriend braved the three-cheese dog which was hard to pick up but looked tasty. Their fries were good and were generously portioned (definitely shareable) for a $1.50 small. Next time we'll delve more into their beer selection.
