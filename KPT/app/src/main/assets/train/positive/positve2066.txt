The Dor-Stop is a great small breakfast restaurant.  Once you enter the doors of pancake heaven you are greeted with friendly staff and the delicious smells of pancakes and meat on the griddle and other various breakfast aromas.  We came Sunday for breakfast and boy does this place fill up!  The Dor-Stop has gained fame from Diners Drive-Ins and Dives but that's not what I care about! I just want the food!  So that's what I did I ordered the food after ordering my coffee.  Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes omelets french toast and eggs cooked to suit.My coffee cup and water were kept full and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage my meal came.  The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium and two large banana chocolate chip pancakes.  I was speechless once I took a bite of that cakey breakfast goodness (the pancakes not the eggs!).  The pancakes are really delicious. They have the perfect texture the perfect taste the perfect look the perfect smell... need I go on?  The eggs were good too I don't want to leave them out but what egg is going to win again the battle of pancakes v eggs?Breakfast BreakdownThe Food: Delicious!The Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee was close to $40. That's not too bad.The Experience:  It's a small restaurant full of happy people! I happened to glance at the table next to us  and saw the breakfast burrito.  It's massive!Would I return?: Why yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday.5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best pancakes in the world.  They were wrong. The Dor-Stop has the best pancakes and for not claiming to have the best they get 5 stars because these pancakes were heaven sent!Bonus game!: How many times were pancakes and breakfast mentioned in this review?
