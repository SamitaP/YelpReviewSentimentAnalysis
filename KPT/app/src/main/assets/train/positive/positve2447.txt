When I go to heaven they will have a Sephora with D's Six Pax's Beer Cave in the back.  And I will be happy.I LOVE this place!  I'd love to take my beer loving father here but i'm afraid his heart would give out with excitement.  If its a good brew it lives here!  I FREAKING LOVE this place.  Can you tell I'm enthusiastic about it?  I recommend you dine here.The food is good I like the black and blue burger but they have just about any kind of hotdog combination you can dream up.  I really love that you can walk back into the beer cave and pick out your beer and they offer cool chillers for it.Here's the best hike in Pittsburgh:  Hike in Frick Park.  take the Falls Ravine trail until you come out near the bridge.  Walk across the bridge.  At Ryan's Pub turn right and walk straight ofr awhile.  You'll come to D's Six Pack and Dogs.  You will be READY for a beer bc its a hike.  But that is the point of hiking.  Eat delicious food and drink beer.  Call a friend to come pick you up and take you home.  The End.In fact its a damn shame they dont offer a gift registry.  Because I would register for beer.  I would.  No judgement.
