Food: 2 stars. It's really not very good. Especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. Blue cheese wasn't bad though. My wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. Nice and fresh though. Drinks: 3 stars for the decent variety (better than expected from a place like this) and the game time specials.Service: 3 stars. Could have been better could have been worse. Friendly but unattentive and not good at realizing when to come to the table. (Hint: if one person calls you over for a drink make sure the rest of us are set before running away.) Atmosphere: 4 stars - really good job of having enough televisions for everyone to see the game/s and marking each so you know what's on. 1 Bonus star for accommodating the Pittsburgh area Buffalo Bills fans! GO BILLS!!!
