Mtchells is one of the best fish places around.  I really like their Shanghi preparation of my fish. It's just delicious.The establishment is always clean the staff courteous and the fish of course fresh.  Oddly enough one of my favorite things about going here besides the fish is the bread they give you.  It's always so warm and tasty.The deserts are also very tasty.  I have gotten two that I really likedThey also have a three course fixed price option last I went that was a great value. I think it was $20/person for lunch.
