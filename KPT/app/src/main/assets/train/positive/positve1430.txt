Wow. Some of the best Italian food I have had in my life. Everything feels authentic straight from Italy and family owned. Where to begin? Well the appetizer selection is incredible my favorite being the provolone fried in truffle oil. The stuffed banana peppers were to die for and I have had many others that were spectacular.For the entree I have had both the veal chop and the filet. The veal chop is almost as large as my arm (not joking) and was delicious prepared either of their two signature ways. For the filet I do not like gorgonzola so I asked them to prepare it a different way (which they are very willing to do and usually announce to the table at the beginning of the meal). It was done is a mushroom sauce that was a perfect compliment to the perfectly cooked filet.Finally do not forget to save room for dessert (which will be fairly difficult considering the sheer volume of food that they give you). The tiramisu is amazing and I would highly recommend trying their gelato. In short my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I would highly recommend a visit especially with a large group. Reservations help but not usually required.
