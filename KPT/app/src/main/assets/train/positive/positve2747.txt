Not a bad place to start your night off before you head out to PNC. It's right near the park and they give you coupons to come back after the game for a free miller light...how cool!! Service is good and they serve Leinie's on tap! (mmmmm summer shandy!) I ordered the buffalo potato cheese pierogies and they were ok. I felt that prices were a little steep but I guess that's the price you pay for being next door to the ball park and connected to a hotel.
