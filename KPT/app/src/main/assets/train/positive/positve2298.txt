Very very VERY good beer selection. I liked going into the beer cave and finding a wide selection of Belgian beers including ones that I hadn't seen since studying abroad in Paris. Hot dogs were excellent and not as messy as I had anticipated; the fries were fantastic. Service was a bit slower than I would've expected for a lazy Monday afternoon. I don't think it takes very long to prepare a hot dog so that's the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.
