My husband and I went to Casbah on our first date night after having our son. Our plan was to take our time and indulge in everything. After we looked through both the wine selection (outstanding) and the menu (delicious) we decided to do things a little differently. Instead of ordering just two entrees we wanted to sample as many libations and treats as possible.First we ordered the white wine flight and split a few seafood appetizers; then we ordered the red wine flight and split a few meaty appetizers; and finally we each ordered a glass of our favorite red and split a chocolate ravioli with raspberry sauce dessert. Our bill was quite pricey but I feel totally worth it. Every single thing we drank and ate was delicate perfect satisfying and well balanced. I would go back and spend the money any time!
