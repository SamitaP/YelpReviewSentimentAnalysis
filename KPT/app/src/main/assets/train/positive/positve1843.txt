I had lunch here this past week and got the sushi lunch special. I was surprised to see that there were only two other tables. The restaurant was dark and provided little in the way of ambiance. For $10 the sushi lunch special included salad miso soup 5 pieces of sushi along with a salmon roll and green tea. As far as how much you got for the money it was a good deal.  On the negative side the sushi was quite average both in terms of taste and freshness.  Little Tokyo which is located on Washington Rd. in Mt Lebanon (about 5 minutes away) has higher quality sushi although it's a little bit pricier. If you are looking for good sushi it's worth the extra five minute drive.
