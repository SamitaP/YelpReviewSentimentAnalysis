I'm a N.Y. thin crust guy.  This pizza is the antithesis of N.Y. style pizza so I didn't really get it.  It's just not my taste but it may be yours so read on.I went with a born & raised Pittsburghian who hasn't lived in the 'burgh for a decade.  He had fond memories of this place so late one night we set out for Beto's.  He was surprised to find that the place is now housed in a fairly new upgraded building giving off a somewhat upscale vibe.Even though it was after midnight they were still serving take out... so hooray for their late night hours.  We orders some cuts (Pittsburgh's way of saying slices) to go and ate them in our car in the parking lot.For the former Pittsburgher the place may have changed but the pizza tasted just as he remembered.  Tangy sauce cuts in rectangular shape crust was bready but had some crunch on its underside.  The unique thing about this pizza is they take it out of the oven and then add the cheese... and alot of it.... so its not altogether melted when you eat it.  My friend loved it.To me it was unique but just okay.  I like a thinner crust cheese melted and cooked all the way through crust less bready.You may like it.  However You just may need to have eaten it as a kid to truly love it.
