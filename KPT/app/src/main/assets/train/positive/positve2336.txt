Any bar and/or restaurant that has D's Nutz on their menu is great-grand-wonderful in my opinion. Let's start with the beer. Say hello to barley-pop heaven here folks. Over 1000 different types of brews? Holy--I thought I blacked out for a second. You take a stroll into either a walk-in cooler or a backroom lined with every beer under the sun pick what you want and toss it into the complimentary cooler. This nifty little guy chills your bottle to whatever your desired temp is fast! We're talking like 3-5 minutes. If it were just for the insanely intricate brew selection D's would be a 5'er star period.Now let's move on to some serious dog biz-nas. This place was recommended to me from a frank-lovin' Pittsburgh-ite as the best place in town to grab one. Welp I ordered my very first Chicago-style hotdog and was not disappointed. In fact holy-fantastic-hot-peppers! The toppings were all so delish and blended perfectly with the dog. It was cooked just right on the outside inside and served up with a freshly steamed bun. Yum. We also skipped the fries and enjoyed a baked soft pretzel instead. This thing was fluffy chewy and delectable. The only thing I would ask for more of is maybe a heftier frank. Don't get me wrong--everything was beyond delicious. I just noticed there wasn't much meatiness involved and with all those topping options you want the hot dog to stand out too. Besides that the atmosphere help and general vibe of this little joint was spot-on. If you're in the 'Burgh you must stop by D's. Seriously.
