Shortly after moving to Dormont while browsing the shops on Potomac I came across the this gem of a diner. It was a Sunday after church and the line was wrapped around the block; as a diner enthusiast this was a fantastic sign. A few days later I brought a friend there for lunch the feta burger I had was amazing. The next time I went with my sister and nephew  I got the burger again and an order of their famous pancakes. The flavor options were long but I choose banana walnut. These where hands down the best pancakes I have ever consumed. The atmosphere is wholesome. The waitstaff is not friendly but accommodating. Honestly they don't have time to be overly friendly they are too busy. However they do a fine job serving you. All in all this place is an A-. The only downside for me was not having The cast from cheers welcome me by name. But the food is remarkable.
