Vincent's has excellent food and awesome service.   On my recent second trip to Pittsburgh I ate there all three nights I was in town because I was blown away by the food and especially the servers.  The restaurant was clean inviting and felt uncrowded even though it was busy.  I will definitely eat there again on my next trip.
