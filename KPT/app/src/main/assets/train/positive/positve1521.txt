I took my boyfriend a German-food enthusiast to Max's Allegheny Tavern last night. We had been looking forward to a night out together for a while. I think the food was good but it's hard to say because all I could focus on was the LOUD -- and I mean LOUD -- woman seated behind my boyfriend and me.Her profanity-laden discussion with her dining partners was so bad that for the first time in my life I turned around and asked a fellow restaurant patron to take the volume down a few notches. The restaurant was almost empty; I have no idea why the host chose to seat a loud party of five next to a couple having a quiet dinner.
