This is our favorite restaurant bar none. The food is terrific the service is top notch they remember our names and it always feels special when we dine there. I've never had a pasta special I didn't adore. I truly feel like they are happy to see us when we come in the door and go to extra pains to treat us well and we are just an average couple who aren't spending hundreds. That doesn't matter - we are their customers. We've been by for lunch which is very competitive price wise with nearby restaurants.
