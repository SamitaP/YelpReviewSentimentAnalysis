Go during  week for specials. Place is normally crowded but takeout is available. Staff is friendly and will cater to your wishes. Food is usually good. Never had any problems.Since this is a chain restaurant you will find one almost anywhere you go. It is great for groups as well as family. My favorite is the eggplant parmesan. They do give unlimited soup or salad with your meal. Be prepared to take food home with you.Place is clean and kempt. It is one of my favorite places to eat when I get the opportunity.
