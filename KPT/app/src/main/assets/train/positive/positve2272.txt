Live close to this place and really like their selection of beers and pizza. However the lunch pizza buffet left ALOT to desire. It was literally a few cold pizzas layed out on a little table. No salad no breadsticks with it. It'd actually to be better to order a large fresh hot pizza and share it. The 'buffet' was for sure a let down.
