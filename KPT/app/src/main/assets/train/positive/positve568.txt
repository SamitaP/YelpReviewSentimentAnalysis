I love Mitchell's Fish Market.  95% of the time the food is amazing but when they mess up they move heaven and earth to make it better.  The last time we were at Mitchell's I ordered the lobster and tenderloin skewers.  My lobster was underdone.  The server was amazing and replaced the lobster tail even though I had eaten most of it.  Then to make our night even better comped us a dessert.  It's that kind of stellar service that keeps us going back.
