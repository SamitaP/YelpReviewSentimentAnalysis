We celebrated my daughter's 12th Birthday at Benihana on 10/16/14.  The food was delicious and the chef was very talented and entertaining!  He did things with the food on the Hibachi we hadn't seen before...a big heart made out of fried rice and made it beat using the spatula.       The only negative was when it came time for them to sing Happy Birthday our waitress was the only one around so our poor waitress was stuck doing the birthday songs by herselfSo we joined in to help her.  No wonder our waitress seemed so unhappy with her job.    I was happy that we had the option of brown rice and not just white or fried rice.
