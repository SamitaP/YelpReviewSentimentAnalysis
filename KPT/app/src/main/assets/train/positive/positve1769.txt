Stumbled on this place on a Sunday afternoon when looking for Yelp recommended Bistro-to-go across the street was closed.Little leery - but very pleasantly surprised!  Nice tables and chairs pleasant service and it was fairly fast.  Woman recommended a large basket of fries to share and they were great!  The Reuben sandwiches were really good!  Two of those a Gyro basket of fries and drinks...a $20 bill!   About the only thing odd was the tiling around their deli case.  No biggie.  We'll go back I want to try the Pizza.  It was really good food and the prices were great!Oh yeah the Pickles were excellent and HUGE!
