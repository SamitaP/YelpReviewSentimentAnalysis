Didn't even know this was a DDD place. We just searched Yelp for something decent in Pittsburgh. The Dor-Stop did not disappoint. The stuffed raspberry French toast was insane. The waitress warned me it was really sweet but I felt that it was perfectly balanced.Definitely check this place out and don't be freaked out at the potential of long waits. We waited 20 mins at 10 am on a Saturday. You'll be fine.
