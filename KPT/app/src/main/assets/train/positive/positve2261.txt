I would love to say that the service and food were wonderful but that would be a complete lie. Beginning with the service I would have expected to receive the type of service from a dive bar or college bar. The servers had no idea what they were doing and payed more attention to their cell phones than the actual customers. When we would randomly get our servers attention she was rude and condescending. We waited 12 minutes to get refills and when she did pick our cups up she grabbed them from the inside (her under nails were black by the way). As was said earlier all the customers around our table were not being attended too because social hour was more important for the servers. The food wasn't too bad but it wasn't anything great. I could compare it to any other bar food. After seeing the way the servers conducted themselves and how they treated their work environment it would not surprise me the kitchen was being treated the same. I have worked in restaurants and hospitality for close to 14 years so i would think i would know how to conduct myself my work environment and most importantly my customers. Giving 3 stars is generous.
