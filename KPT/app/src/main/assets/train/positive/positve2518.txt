I can't believe I'm the first to review!My husband and I saw something about the Triangle Bar and Grill on an old WQED rerun about good places to eat in PA.  We stopped by yesterday and are VERY glad we did.  The Battleship hoagie fed us for 2 meals (3 feet of sandwich with 2 lbs of meat!) and that's saying a lot we like our food!... and it was only 12.95!  It was one of the best sandwiches I've had hands down.  We are definitely going back!
