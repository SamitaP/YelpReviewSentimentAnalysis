Not only does this place have a very nice atmosphere the food is good (and cheap) too!For under 10 dollars a person we each got:-A drink-A Bradtwurst sausage-2 giant potato pancakes served with sourcream (note that these are NOT latkes)-A huge bowl of saurkraut which also contained some pork and cranberries.Delicious home-baked bread which was served with some saurkraut (prepared differently than the side) and apple-butter sauce.YUM!It's hard not to like this place. I'm still having cravings for those pancakes :(
