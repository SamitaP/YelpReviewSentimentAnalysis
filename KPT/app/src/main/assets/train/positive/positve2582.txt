Had a wonderful experience at Benihana with the family last night.  We love hibachi restaurants and go to various area restaurants on a regular basis.  Benihana is the oldest of the hibachi restaurants in the area so we had not been for a while.  We arrived early before the rest of our party and the staff was very welcoming.  They would regularly stop by and make sure we didnt need anything.  After our party arrived we were seated and our chef came out. He was very entertaining and the food tasted amazing.  The best part was how accommodating the staff was.  One member of our party had a food allergy and the manager specifically came over to ensure that all food would be made in the back and would not come in contact with other ingredients.We had our 2 year old daughter with us and part way through the meal she started squirming and wanted to walk around the restaurant.  After a few laps of the restaurant without us asking the manager came out with crayons and paper which made our daughter VERY happy.  Everyone was so pleasant and the food was better than I had remembered.  Benihana has a lot of competition from Saga Nakama and others but after our most recent visit Benihana definitely has the best value and the best staff.  We visited Saga shortly after going to Benihana and just kept commenting on how much better Benihaha was.
