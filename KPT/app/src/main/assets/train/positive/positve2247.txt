Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. They use a bread dough recipe handed down from their grandmother and a sauce that is to die for. Awesome beer selection as well. Word of advice from someone who's been dining here since they were across the street and known as Pizza Piazza - don't introduce yourself to the pizza via the lunch buffet - it's too delicate and dries out under the heat lamp. Order it fresh with extra sauce and enjoy!
