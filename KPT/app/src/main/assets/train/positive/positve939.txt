After a long day of recruiting at CMU I arranged a dinner for 16 people here in Casbah... Prefix menu over all the experience was ok.Break down:Scallops - Appetizer - I had high expectation but it came out a bit too over spiced.  Very rich i am glad they only gave me two.  Fillet Mignon - Entree - Very tender piece of meat but no wear near as good as some of the places here in the Silicon Valley or even some of the chain steak places like Morton's.Dessert - The highlight of the of the meal.  Mango panna cotta with some sorbet.  It was amazing.  The consistency of the panna cotta was perfect.  It wasn't too dense or too liquidy.Being a Big Burrito restaurant I expected more but it was good nonetheless.
