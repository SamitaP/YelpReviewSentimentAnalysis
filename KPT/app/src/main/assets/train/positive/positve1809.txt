Not a bad choice for a neighborhood pizza place. We live about 1 1/2 miles from here and they won't deliver up Brighton Road which is kind of an annoyance. The pizza is decent and I like their sauce. The garlic bread and breadsticks aren't too shabby. The prices are certainly reasonable. Admittedly I've never tried the subs. And most nights when you call they put you on hold right away because there is only one person answering the phone and that person seems to be busy cooking as well. But the pizza is leaps and bounds better than Mandy's which is downright terrible. Not a bad little local pizza spot overall.
