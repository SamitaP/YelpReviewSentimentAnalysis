One year since my first venture to Casbah I had the chance to return for a second time. And I have to say that I am officially a die-hard Casbah fan.Yes our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off dinner coupon beforehand. Even better they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.The amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops arugula salad duck pork and veal meatballs and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.Casbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons and I'm completely sold. Here's to the next special occasion and dinner out at Casbah!
