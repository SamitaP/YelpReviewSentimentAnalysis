A crowded yet cozy place to get a great dog. The beer cave is impressive and the rotating drafts have something for everyone. I had the pulled pork dog which had just the right amount of hot dog pulled pork and sauerkraut. The fries were well fried and not oily or overly crispy. The bar area was well kept and clean and I enjoyed the first dog so much I had to get another. If you can find a spot to sit you won't be disappointed.
