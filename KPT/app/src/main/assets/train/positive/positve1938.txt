This is a place where people either love it or hate it. Beto's offers thin square cuts. They bake the tray of pizza with a handful or two of cheese. When it comes out they pile fresh cold cheese and toppings. If you eat it right away you get the unique flavors of warm crust hot sauce cold shredded cheese & cold toppings. It's a unique style & in my opinion ranks Beto's in the top 3 pizza spots in Pittsburgh.In addition to their pizza I think Beto's has the best Italian hoagies in Pittsburgh. I believe their cheese is what elevates their food. Absolutely amazing!
