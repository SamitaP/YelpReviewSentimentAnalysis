This place came highly recommended when I moved to Pittsburgh two years ago. They have an amazing beer selection good dogs and they must have expanded the place in the last year because they have a pull up garage wall that I never noticed before. Fries are good too. Something about it is gimmicky to me but I'll let it go. Might as well stop here first before going to see a movie across the street...
