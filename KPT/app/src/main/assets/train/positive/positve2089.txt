Probably my favorite breakfast spot in the city.  Yes Pamela's hot cakes are amazing but this place has the best all-around breakfast for sure.Best thing to do is get there right when they open.  Don't be surprised if there isn't already a crowd standing outside.  If you do have to wait for a table be patient it's totally worth it.  Try the hotcakes.  My favorite is the pumpkin flavor they have end of summer/fall.  They're SO fluffy and delicious.
