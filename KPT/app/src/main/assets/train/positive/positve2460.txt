D's has been hovering among my Pittsburgh bookmarks for a couple of years now so I was happy to finally stop by for a visit and late lunch recently. After squeezing into a parallel parking spot out front I had two things on my mind when walking in here: hotdogs and beer both of which they have down pat.Since it was mid-afternoon few tables were filled but the front patio was open to allow in some fresh air during the nice day. I first looked around at their extensive beer selections; six pax in the rear Beer Cave and individual bottles in the middle cooler. I found something to my liking and grabbed a high table and menu.A Big Ben dog sounded appetizing (and mildly appropriate) but I ended up going with the Mason Dixon topped with chili and coleslaw. Knowing that one dog would not be enough I also went with a small order of their Pub Fries covered in cheese and bacon. (Forgive me Father for I have no restraint.)Holy Moley! Both the dog and fries were excellent and down right tasty. Thank God because my satisfied stomach was smacking down the guilty part of my brain that was subconsciously calculating the summation of calories shared between the meal and two bottles of liquid refreshment.Oh well. I definitely heart D's even if my heart now hates me in return. 4.5 Stars.
