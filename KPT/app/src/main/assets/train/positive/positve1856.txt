I was in the mood for some Chinese and really wanted to try Red Tea House because I've heard really great things about it but they have strange delivery times and I was unable to pick the food up myself... so I opted for Green Garden instead.I sampled vegetable egg foo young hot & sour soup and bean curd with mixed vegetable. I received three generous eggy vegetable pancakes which had potential but unfortunately they were left in the frier a little too long and soaked in a lot of excess grease. I think the accompanying sauce is actually beef gravy and bland (The great thing about eating at home is the opportunity to improvise...I whipped up a quick peanut sauce that went great with the egg foo young)The hot and sour soup was decent they use fresh mushrooms and the broth is a nice consistency (i.e. not too thick). The bean curd and veggies were nothing fancy the veggies held some crunch and the curd had a palatable texture but was drowning in brown sauce. The food was piping hot and delivered fast.
