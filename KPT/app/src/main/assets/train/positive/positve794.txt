The espresso is definitely good. Although the interior is strange the location is cute for Highland Park. My beef is with the snarky Pittsburgh hipster Employee's that barely even engaged with my jokes made about their Beta Fish Vivian. Seriously a boy Beta named Vivian! That fish needs some recognition and love. After basically flirting with ourselves it seemed like all they cared about was acting cool and barely providing an engaging espresso experience for me and my friend who were obviously excited to be there! Next time maybe there will be different employee's. But I have a feeling their lack of enthusiasm for serving the general public will deter me elsewhere. Sad times Tazza I felt like I could have really loved you.
