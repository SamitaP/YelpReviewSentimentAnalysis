HOLY MOLEY that was some good breakfast at 2:00 in the afternoon!  I had the oatmeal pancakes and I have not stopped thinking about them since.  My wife had a vegetable breakfast burrito and I stole some so I can say that was pretty awesome too.  I'm now looking for an excuse to get back to this part of Pittsburgh so I can eat here again.
