The food is good the service is great the parking is HORRIBLE! This place is always packed! Brunch Lunch or Dinner plan on hunting for a parking spot waiting for a table and enjoying yourself AFTER you are seated. They have a bar and also serve drinks at the tables. The food is great (I love their salad) and the service couldn't be better.
