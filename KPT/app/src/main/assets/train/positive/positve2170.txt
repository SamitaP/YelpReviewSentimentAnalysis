We love this place!! My daughter and I stop her every now and again and they have an AMAZING breakfast spread. We both got our usuals today...kids chocolate chip pancakes and bacon for her and the egg breakfast for me. The most perfectly done eggs EVER with tasty sausage patties rye toast and to die for homefries. My daughters pancakes tasted like heavenly chocolate  chip cookies yummo!! The staff here is SO friendly!! They make you feel very at home!! I would definitely recommend stopping for a bite :)
