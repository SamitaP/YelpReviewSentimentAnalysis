Dunning's Grill is another one of those solid neighborhood joints.  Nothing on the menu here'll surprise you but you'll get good chow for your buck here.  We're taling standard bar fare here--burgers wraps fish sandwiches and variations of fried and grilled chicken.  It's a good place to meet up with your friends before or after a movie at the nearby Regent's Square as I did.  I had the BLT which was as good as any other BLT I've had at least a dozen other places.  They have vegetarian options here but if you're a true vegetarian or vegan be forewarned!  They're really meatless variations of their regular menu items.
