i really like this place and if i were in squirrel hill more often i'd definitely visit more. there is only one reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars but i'll get to that in a minute.the first i had heard of d's was their six pack shop. they have a large selection of room-temp cold domestic craft import normal-size giant bottles that you can make your own 6 pack with. this was the first place i had ever been to with those kind of options but now i realize (here's why one star is taken off) the prices for 6 packs are not nearly as wonderful as the selection. now obviously with mixed bottles the price will go up especially if you have expensive kinds in there. but it seems they charge full price per bottle which is a pretty lousy deal in the end.but prices for eat/drink-in are totally acceptable! in fact i don't believe i had ever eaten at d's until a recent yelp event. their hot dogz are FANTASTIC and i only had a beef dog with sauerkraut not exactly anything fancy. i also got to sample their hummus and dry-rub bbq wings both of which were also super tasty.the service is always really friendly here too. there's plenty of room to sit down (bar table loft upstairs with a bar and a few tables). and there's even darts upstairs too.d's is definitely worth checking out and if you've never seen the 6-pack cave at least take a browse buy one if you're feeling spendy or simply don't have a place like this anywhere near you.
