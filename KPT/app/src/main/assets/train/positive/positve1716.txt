I've been here a few times. Can't beat five dollar Coors Light pitchers... The crowd tends to be black. I tend to be white. And obviously from out of town. People are friendly. It's just a neighborhood bar. People talk to each other and have a good time. The food is well priced and good. The music is going to blow your ears up if you care about that don't come.
