All I can say bombass pancakes!  Minus a star for the stares! I forget sometimes where I am. Traditional old school greasy breakfast. Everything homemade!  The cook & our waitress was cool. I guess they started chatting with us b/c the regulars couldn't stop glaring.  I guess it' worth the 2 to 4 hr on the weekends. Luckily I came in on a weekday. Maybe that's why all the stares?  I don't care. Just give me my pancakes sausages & hash browns  that Guy raves about. Everyone who works there was really good & portions were fit for steel workers.
