I am always up for trying out one of those places featured on food network. The wait to get into this place was long and goes out the door. Its a very small restaurant with about 15 tables at best. Its one of the divey places where the staff clearly knows what they're doing and does it right. when we finally did sit and order service was fast. I had a meat omelet with hashbrowns. Im not much of a breakfast person so I wasnt overly impressed with it. Large portions though. I would come back here to try more of the menu.
