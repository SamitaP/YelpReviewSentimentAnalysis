This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the South Hills.  I'm often in the area during the afternoons and the Sichuan House makes for an excellent and inexpensive lunch!  My favorite is the Cashew Chicken and they don't skimp on the chicken.  I always leave with a full stomach and that's just the lunch portion!  The prices and portions go up for the dinner crowd but the food is always worth it.  The staff here are very attentive and friendly and very gracious upon exit.  The decor is ho-hum and anything but elegant but you unnecessarily pay more for fancy atmosphere at some other area Chinese restaurants.  Highly recommended!
