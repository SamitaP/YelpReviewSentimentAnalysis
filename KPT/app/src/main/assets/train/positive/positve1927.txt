I've had a rough day. A really rough day.  I'm not even hungry. I really want to do nothing but sleep. But I CAN'T. You know why? Betos pizza is down the street! I can't miss out on the amazingness that is betos. This has been a staple in my family for several generations and i try to stop here whenever I can. The secret to their pizza- a combination of regular melted cheese and then a whole bunch of cold cheese on top. It creates a beautiful harmony of dairy delights. This is deserving of a normal picture.
