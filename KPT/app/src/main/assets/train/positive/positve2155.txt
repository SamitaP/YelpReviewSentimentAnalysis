So with all the hype I was expecting fireworks.  Maybe I am tainted.  When you come from California where the food is very fresh you are sometimes disappointed this was one of those times.My son watches triple d was so excited to be here but at best was ok.  No fireworks.I had the veggie burrito my one son the egg burrito and other son had the egg breakfast.  I ordered a side of bacon also.My waitress brought out three scoops of sour cream in little white contains soggy to say the least.My burrito good; kids food was ok eggs terrible bacon Terrible.  I love bacon love it this bacon was cheap tasting and tasted like the girdle.  Gross...Sorry Dor-stop.  If your every in Folsom Cali try Mary's gold miner cafe.  The bomb!
