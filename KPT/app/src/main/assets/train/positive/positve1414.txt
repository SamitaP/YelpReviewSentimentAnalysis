I was in Pittsburgh (my hometown) for a visit from Boston.  I was so pleased with the meal at this restaurant.  It was by far the best restaurant I have ever been to in the Burgh.  The wait staff chef food was stellar.  We are known for very good restaurants in Boston and this restaurant could be in Boston or NYC it is that fantastic!  I would highly recommend going here if you have a special occasion date night or just want a superb meal.
