After reading some peoples reviews I wasn't sure of this place. My boyfriend and I decided to go anyways. All I can say is wow you people don't know food if you left a negative remark! Our food was phenomenal. The service was phenomenal. No it isn't a super fancy place but the food is incredible and very reasonably priced. Our $56 dinner was worth every penny. I had a special he had ravioli's and we split a desert. Amazing little place that I will 100% go to again.
