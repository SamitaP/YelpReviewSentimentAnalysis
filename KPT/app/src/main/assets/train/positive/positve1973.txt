I came here for my first time the other day and was extremely suprised at what I found. This has an very nice bar area with an excellent draft beer selection and great tasting appetizers. I had the hot wings which I for one was extremely happy with. I would have given this 5 stars but I did wait a very long time for my wings and to be honest I don't think I would have received them if I wouldn't have asked the Bartender about it. I was not that disappointed though because it allowed me to try another variety of beers on tap.I will definitely go back soon!
