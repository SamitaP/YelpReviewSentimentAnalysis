Great place to have a party!  Bado's is located in a cute section of Mount Lebanon with street parking or a metered parking lot in the back (it was only $5 for a 24 hour period).  Our friends rented out the top part of the restaurant for a 30th birthday party. This was a large space which could easily fit over 50 people comfortably.  There was a small bar with 3 draft beers to choose from tables set up for food and tables to sit at.  We were served their huge pepperoni pizza which was very tasty!  The sauce was sweet and a thin crust.  Downstairs they had a nice selection of draft beers to choose from.  They also have a rooftop section!
