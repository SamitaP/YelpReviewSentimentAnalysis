Think fresh bread fresh vegetables daily sliced meats of the highest caliber served in white butcher paper by very slow service.  Ahhhh the joys of ordering a torpedo (around six inches of bread) or a Battleship (fasten the hatches!) from the Triangle.  They make the best cold hoagies -- turkey italian and ham are among my favorites!  They also have a bar and TV's for that minimalist game viewing adventure with regulars from nearby homestead and braddock propping up the stools.  It's a great take out place -- call ahead though.  A Pittsburgh classic you must try once for a Steeler or Penguin game party.  Terrific!
