We had a bigger party and I think that might have flustered the waitresses just a bit. They forgot about our waters until the food came out but were super apologetic when they did bring them. The food was ok. I ordered the crab cakes they were a bit heavy on the breading so I would give them a rating of eh. My friend ordered a steak asked for medium rare and it came out...well done. He was too hungry to complain and just ate it. We might go back again and this time maybe take a bit more time looking over the menu.
