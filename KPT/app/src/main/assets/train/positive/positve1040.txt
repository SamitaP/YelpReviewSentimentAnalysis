This is definitely one of the most interesting places I've been to in a good way. Casbah is a great local place that serves smaller (but admittedly pricey) portions and they change their menu up frequently to match the ingredients available to them each season.The set-up is...different? I couldn't quite figure out what was going on with it; you basically walk into a door and enter what looks like what was once a courtyard which was covered with a canvas - maybe they take this down during the summer? Possibly? I'm not sure; anyway if you walk to the back of the courtyard you'll get into the actual bar.The menu here at least during my visit was delicious - fantastic fresh sangria a very interesting but tasty bruschetta (that rather than going with the traditional tomatoes and basil was covered in a kind of cream cheese greens and nuts) and a reasonably portioned bowl of pasta with sausage and spinach. Not complaints other than the fact that the pasta was a bit spicy and I wasn't warned about this. It wasn't too strong though.Our waitress was doing the best that she could (I think) but was a little slow. Still the place was fairly busy and I had good company to talk to during my meal so no hard feelings on that one.I say give this place a try if you have the money to spare - and even then get a coupon or a Groupon; I went with someone who was using a birthday gift card and it helped the pricing tremendously.
