Not the best I've had....but better than most in the area for the price. Dumplings were huge! Rice is good and breading on chicken was crispy!...something that seems to elude most cheap/fast Chinese places in Greentree/Scott/Mt Lebanon. Good egg rolls. Hard to beat for the price.I'll be back to order the massive dumplings again and again.On second thought the best I've had in the month living in Pittsburgh.  Will try others but to date stands above the rest
