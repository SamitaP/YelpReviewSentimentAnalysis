I've been here twice for brunch with some friends. My first time was confusing for my friend and I because there was a line and we didn't know we had to sign in. After we were seated we ordered food. The waitress was slow and unfriendly. She seemed irritated that we were there. The food was amazing as our orders were small and uncomplicated we just wanted to try the food. The second time was pretty much the same. The food was great and filling but the servers were unfriendly and slow. Disheartening and not really worth dealing with for some pancakes. Try it out for the legend like I did but beyond the food it's not much.
