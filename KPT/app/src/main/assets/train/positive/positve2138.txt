Dor-Stop is the place to go in Pittsburgh if you want great breakfast. Having been featured on Food Network's Diners Drive-Ins and Dives it has become a well known place to enjoy the mornings and afternoons of the weekend. Located on a quaint street in Dormont Dor-Stop is always full to the brim with awaiting customers. I ordered a plate full of gooey chocolate pancakes with a side of sausage patties and lyonnaise potatoes. The pancakes were so so delicious. They were thick and dense but weren't too thick that they were difficult to eat. The sausage patties were cooked just right. They were juicy and greasy and simply amazing. The lyonnaise potatoes were a nice addition. They are my favorite type of potato. My boyfriend got Guy's version of the jumbot. It was loaded with hot sausage potatoes eggs and peppers. He loved it and so did I! The atmosphere of Dor-Stop is that of a typical diner. Various memorabilia and other types of old-time posters adorn the walls which makes for a very comfortable feel. The service was great for being so busy and we only had to wait a short amount of time for our food. I definitely plan on coming back here as soon as possible to try the other great options on the menu. The raspberry stuffed French toast looked amazing!
