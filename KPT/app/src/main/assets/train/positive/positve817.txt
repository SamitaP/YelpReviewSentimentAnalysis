This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea coffee snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  The staff is great and the prices are reasonable too. The only change I could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. It'd make the vibe a little more comfortable!
