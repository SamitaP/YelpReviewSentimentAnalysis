Great atmosphere wonderful service and really great food. My husband and I shared the Brat sandwich and the sampler with schnitzel Lichtenstein sauerbraten and something with an 'l' that I can't remember the spelling of (ground loaf)....all were excellent. We had the sauerkraut and spatzle and cabbage as sides. The bread brought out before the meal included apple butter and sweet & sour relish (cabbage) and those were excellent too. Would love the sweet & sour relish in a side size portion it is so delicious. The red dining room is nicely decorated and love the cuckoo clock that is reminiscent of my grandmother's. The beer out of the mason jar is a fun touch.  Our bill came to $29 (1 beer 1 diet coke for our drinks) and it was a fabulous meal for so little.
