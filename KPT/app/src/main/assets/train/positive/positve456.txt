First time eating at PF Chang- thought the food was fine but I'd rather go to an authentic Chinese restaurant any day. It felt like a Chinese version of the Cheesecake factory.  Anyway it was a Saturday late afternoon and despite lots of empty tables we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and after that waited 30 min  for our food.  I don't know if they were just short staffed the day we went but I wasn't impressed with the service.Some nice items on the menu include the lettuce wraps and the salt and pepper calamari which comes with a separate dish of salt and pepper for dipping. The sesame chicken was also very good.  Other things were fine just not memorable.  I think this is an OK place to eat if you happen to be shopping at the Waterfront and don't mind spending a little time over lunch or dinner. If you want to get in and out in a hurry don't come here.
