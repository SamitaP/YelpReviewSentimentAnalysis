Wow... This was not just a dinner it was an amazing experience.  From the moment you walk in they treat you like you are family. The bartender up stairs was an encyclopedia of knowledge on the beer and spirits he had. Then there is the dining experience. By far the best food ive ever had i drove from ohio just to dine here and it was worth every penny and every mile.
