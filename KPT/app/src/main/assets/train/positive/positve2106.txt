I dream about this place and how yummy it is you should expect a wait on the weekends because I'm not the only one who feels that way.   Right now I'm on a potato pancake kick I seriously can't walk out of there without having them.  They are also quite famous for their regular pancakes white are deliciously dense I don't think we've ever had anyone at our table finish their pancakes but they heat up well the next day to prolong the decadence!
