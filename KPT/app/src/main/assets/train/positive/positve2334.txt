I go to D's almost every Wednesday night for a beer and a veggie dog after an hour of bouldering at the Wall.Their beer selection changes often and I've never been disappointed.  If I don't know what the beer is they'll often bring over a sample to try to make sure I like it.The veggie dogs are great the cheese fries are great and I've never had a problem with the service.   It can get crowded when a game is on but just grab a beer and wait for a table.Pros: Fun menu great draft beer selection beer cave!Cons: Sometimes crowded and loud
