Definitely my favorite German restaurant this place brings back memories.... often a bit negative as it's right near the hospital... yes my Mom took me there after my arm breaking fiasco that time I got hit by the car etc. etc. (I was obviously an uncoordinated child) but also wonderful as I could literally lose myself in their vast array of tasty foods.  It's definitely a North Side staple and the atmosphere has a well worn appeal with old pictures of the local Germanic community and of the area.  This place has it's own personality which is a plus in my opinion!As for the food... well you can't find much better German food than this and at this price!  Both of my parents favor the peasant platter.  Me I love the stuffed pretzel appetizer all the different sausages (the weisswurst is amazing!) and their kasespatzle (thick doughy egg noodles with butter and cheese).  I will always associate Max's with the best most flavorful German food at an affordable price!
