I had heard from friends that Casbah was one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and my experience definitely lived up to the hype.  I don't know how a place owned by a company called Big Burrito Group churns out such outstanding Mediterranean fare but I was impressed.  Everything was done right--the ambiance was sophisticated yet unpretentious service was professional and the wine list was impressive especially the by-the-glass options which were necessary since I was dining solo.  The food (I started with grilled Spanish octopus and then had the halibut) was all fresh and prepared to perfection with inventive flavoring that complimented rather than overwhelmed the dishes themselves.  I'm not in Pittsburgh often--too bad it is a beautiful city--but I would visit Casbah again without hesitation.
