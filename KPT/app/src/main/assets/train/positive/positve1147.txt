I was really impressed by this place. I will first start with the service: The waiter was very friendly and it took me awhile to go over the menu since I've never been there. He was patient and stated take your time no hurry. He offered me suggestions. We even discussed shoes for a brief minute very personable. The food: The menu was quite extensive...hoagies soups pasta salads etc. They also have stuff for kids like grilled cheese. I ended up ordering the lentil loaf with steamed vegetables and smashed potatoes. The food came out QUICK like 5 minutes and everything was fresh and great. Did I mention this also came with soup? I paid $13 total for my meal and a cold chai. Could not ask for more. My only and I mean only complaint is that they only serve lunch at lunch time the only serve dinner at dinner time etc..so be mindful of the time of day you go....
