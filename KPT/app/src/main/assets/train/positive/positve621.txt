Lots of memories from this place for me.  Their pizza may not be the best in the world but boy does it take me back to the 80's-90's and growing up in Pittsburgh.I am slightly disappointed that they moved to a new location in Bellevue.  Their old one while a bit dirty and run down had quite the charm to it.  The new place looks too clean cut and it seems like they're trying to be something they're not which is just a good old fashioned pizza joint.
