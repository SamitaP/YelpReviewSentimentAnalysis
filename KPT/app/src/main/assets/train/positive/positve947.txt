Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.For $22 you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. I started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut and the home fries were crispy on the outside soft on the inside.I tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil drowning out the eggs. Also service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter forget his name but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy always friendly and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.For brunch in Pittsburgh this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!Now I just need to make plans to go back for dinner.
