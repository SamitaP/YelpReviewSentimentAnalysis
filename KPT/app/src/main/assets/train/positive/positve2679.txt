I know a lot of people tend to either love or hate Panera; I happen to love it - the You-Pick-2 combo is one of my favorite lunch options. And as luck (good or bad depending on how my diet's going!) would have it this location provides a daily opportunity to get one of those combos! This location is incredibly convenient for me - both for being relatively close to where I live and for being next to an old bookstore clothes store and a few other businesses - and has earned all 5 stars for being a bit better than the average Panera. One I've never walked in here and found a shortage in sweet treats which is a common problem if I want an afternoon bagel in a lot of other Panera locations. Two the sandwiches here just taste fresher than a lot of other places I've been to. Three as others have mentioned the staff are just nicer here - I have no idea why but I'm not complaining! Bonus star for this Panera because it's actually made its entire interior comfortable and encourages people to relax and use its wi-fi which is something I can't say a lot of other locations have nailed just yet.
