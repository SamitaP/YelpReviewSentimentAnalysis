First this is a big chain - not my favorite type of eatery.  For me four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly unique...However!  The Chilean Sea Bass Marinated in Oolong Tea is freakin' fantastic!  10+Now - everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very good.I've been to PFC Vegas and PFC NYC - our Homestead PFC definitely beats them both.  So many great little places to try in the 'Burgh but I wouldn't resist going back to this particular PFC.
