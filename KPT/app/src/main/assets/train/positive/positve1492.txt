I was born and raised in the Ohio Valley eating DiCarlo's from all different branches in the area.  When I moved to Pittsburgh I figured I would only get my favorite pizza when I visited home.  Not the case!  Pittsburgh DiCarlo's is delicious and a taste of home.  For anyone familiar with other DiCarlo's it is the same shape (square) and sold by the slice and has the same crunchy yet chewy crust.  The cheese is grated like the cheese at the Elm Grove DiCarlo's location in Wheeling but the sauce is more like most of the other DiCarlo's (there's just something special about the Elm Grove sauce that hasn't been replicated in the other branches).  I'm thrilled it's up here and close to my new home and I will definitely be back!
