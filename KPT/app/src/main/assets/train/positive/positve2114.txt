I've been living in the neighborhood for almost a year now and finally got to try out this place. It did not disappoint!  I've been asked why I have it only 3 stars with such a glowing review. Well I don't prefer greasy spoon joints but if it's your thing u will like it! What makes this greasy spoon joint different than others is the amazing variety of pancakes and french toasts- you will not get bored with your breakfast here! As a standard on the menu they have many flavors to choose from: pumpkin banana blueberry choco chip raspberry etc. I ordered the special of the day: chocolate cherry cheesecake pancakes. They were pretty good! I liked that there were actual cherry pieces in the filling- I appreciate real fruit being used in my breakfasts. If u like a pancake that holds up against the weight of toppings and syrup while maintaining a soft spongey texture you will like these. I hate when pancakes get immediately soggy- these do not! The boyfriend ordered Bob's specialty as it is not a standard breakfast item either- eggs with German potato pancakes applesauce and sour cream- it did not disappoint! The potato pancakes were a tad on the sweet side but I liked them. Another great thing here is the down-home feel of the place- everyone is very friendly. While we were waiting in line (which by the way wasn't too long they get people in and out pretty fast) they handed out small samples of coffee. This was much appreciated on such a cold day!
