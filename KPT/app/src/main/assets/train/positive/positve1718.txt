Great place to go for a cheap lunch if your in the area. Steves is a great local dive for burgers and dogs. They are a great alternative to hospital food if you work at or are are visiting someone at Allegheny General Hospital. They offer burgers hot dogs grilled cheese chicken and ham sandwiches BLTs kielbasa fish sandwiches and fries. Burgers start at $1.00 and hot dogs start at 93 cents. You can add chili sauerkraut cheese and jalapenos to their hot dogs. There is a small counter to eat at but most people get their food to go. The food is great and the prices are even better. CASH ONLY!
