Some people don't know that Beto's Pizza is identical to DiCarlo's Pizza.  The big difference is that DiCarlo's Pizza is much less expensive.  The DiCarlo's Pizza in Elm Grove on the SE side of Wheeling is very good.  The very best DiCarlo's Pizza is in Steubenville out near Wintersville.I've never thought the people at the counter at Beto's were very friendly.  It's also hard to find a table because the waitresses are very slow to clean off tables after other customers vacate them so someone else can use the table.
