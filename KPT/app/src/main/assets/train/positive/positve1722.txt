Classic North Side staple.  The food is made to order the service is fast and the staff is great.  My stand order is hot dog with onions and a side of fries.  But the grilled cheese is also exceptional.  The lunch line can be unreal so I usually just stop for dinner on my way home from work.CASH ONLY.
