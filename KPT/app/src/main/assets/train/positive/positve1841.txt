Just moved to the area so I was looking for a good sushi place. This is a nice little joint.  It's very intimate but they would have no problem seating a large party.  When my BF and i arrived we were the only ppl there (it was memorial day so sushi isn't too high up ppls lists for dinner)  We ordered the spicy Edamame and 4 rolls.  Everything was reasonably priced and very good.  Staff was friendly!Will definitely be back!
