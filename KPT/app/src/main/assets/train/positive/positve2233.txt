I live in walking distance so I have been here many times . The place is very clean and the menu has many choices ... Not just pizza and hoagies . The bar is well stocked and has many varieties of beer . I would suggest coming here for breakfast or brunch on the weekends . The omlettes are huge . The only drawback is the place very small and can get crowded . You can't have a discussion without hearing what the people sitting at the next table are talking about as well . There is sometimes a wait to get a table . Good place to take the family  a date or just yourself . This place is alot like Vincents of  Green Tree.
