I love two things: beer and hot dogs. I really love hot dogs.Gross I know right? My bf is a vegetarian and he won't come near me with hot dog breath. But this place has veggie hot dogs too!!! Not to mention- the amazing amazing beer selection. Definitely one of the best I've seen in the Pittsburgh area. Coolers line the back wall and part of the perimeter of the store. If you get take out it's a dollar off a bottle! Yayyy. They also have a cooler that (I think) is constantly reserved for whatever seasonal beers are appropriate at the time. Mmmmmm.Try the Roethlisberger hot dog it's got cole slaw and french fries on it.
