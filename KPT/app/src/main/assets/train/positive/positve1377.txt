Fantastic cozy & artistic & foreign ambiance. Good food. Great decor.(For the record I tried my first liver here - which I thought would be pate but was not - to my hidden horror. I ate a bite - in front of my clients & colleagues - for good measure [and to hide my naievete] but they eventually noticed I was not eating it. I politely humbly explained my mistake and they respected me for trying something new. Of course my client then told me about blood tofu which was a bit shocking but I firmly believe in expanding one's own mind and perceptions of the world and all its cultures so I appreciated his sharing. Adding this experience to that of eating bone marrow here at Pulpo in D.C.)
