After a long day at work I met up with a friend for some German fair on the northside. I don't get out to this neck of the woods that often so it was a treat for me! All appetizers are  $2.99 during happy hour so we went with the Potato pockets which were perogies in my book. They were crispy and creamy and topped with fried onions. They also had a side of french onion sour cream. Pretty tasty stuff! Plus they gave you so many I could have filled up just on the app. I ordered the Bell's Oberon while my dining partner ordered the sampler. I have to say that she wasn't that impressed with the brew. Dirty pipes and I quote. I had the same taste from my order so I focused on the food.We both ended up ordering Max's Goulash that was suggested by another Yelper! You can't go wrong when you have that recommendation. This is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef. The noodles in this feast were homemade and chunky piled high with a peppery meaty sauce infused with fall off the fork beef carrots peas and tiny pearl onions. If you remember yesterday was a cold rainy gloomy day. This was real comfort and I had to take it to go. Rain is still in the forecast so leftovers will be grand!
