I've been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend. I enjoyed eating here well enough.I'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food although I guess that wouldn't have mattered: a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this place's menu is mostly Americanized - proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with French fries (only in Pittsburgh...). Trust me even if you don't really like German food there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.Thinking about my usual overall summary I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for. It wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect.
