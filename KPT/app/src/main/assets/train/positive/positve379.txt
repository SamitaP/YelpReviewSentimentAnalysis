I must say my experience last night at Bar Louie was wonderful. I was hesitant to go because of the other reviews here but my husband convinced me to give it a try. The place is seat yourself and it's LOUD in there. I was a little underwhelmed by that at first but I got used to it and found myself enjoying the energy.Our service was fantastic. Courtney was great - super attentive brought our drinks out in less than 5 minutes brought our food quickly checked on us just enough... And the place was packed.The drinks were perfect just strong enough. We tried the Peach Lighting and the Tiki drink. I liked the tiki thing better but that's just personal choice. There were real berries mixed into that one. Yum.On to the food... My turkey/ham/Brie sandwich was delicious and my husband loved his burger. The highlight of the meal though was the Whiskey cake. Sonnet-worthy.We'll definitely go back again.
