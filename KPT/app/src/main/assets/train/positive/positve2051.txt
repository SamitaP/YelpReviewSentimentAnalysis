Do I really need to write a review of this place you know it is good. I'm a breakfast guy and usually go with a simple egg and toast breakfast but today I went with the eggs Benedict that was really freaking Delicious and the portion was gigantic to me. For the $8 or so I spent it was a hell of a deal. My only recommendation to someone who hasn't been here before is to just not even come here on the weekends it is such a pain because it is so busy. Come here during the week for a  more relaxing breakfast.
