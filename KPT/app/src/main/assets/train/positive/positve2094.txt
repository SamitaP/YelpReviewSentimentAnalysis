Surely you've read enough reviews to know you HAVE to go to the Dor Stop. Have to. No matter where you are or how far of a drive it is do it. Oh sure you're a Pamela's fan or DeLuca's and swear there can't be anything better around. Oh my friend don't be deceived. I too am a fan of those places. Love them. BUT get your butt to the Dor Stop!!! You will open a new frontier in breakfast possibilities that will have your taste buds shouting hallelujah!Oh my! The banana chocolate chip pancakes are to die for. And the oatmeal raisin ones? You won't believe something that is that good for you tastes like that!! And the raspberry French toast? Amazing - but only if you can afford the calories! But do it at least once! And their egg scrambles with your choice of ingredients? This is breakfast nirvana. None better in the city. None.
