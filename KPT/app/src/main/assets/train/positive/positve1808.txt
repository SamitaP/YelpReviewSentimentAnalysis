I was tired of all my usual delivery haunts (can they be haunts if you're never physically there?) so I tried Chubby's. Unfortunately named but they've got seriously low prices and I was feeling broke so why not? I got two whole hoagies for $9.50 plus a $1 fuel surcharge -- not bad.Oh the food? It's pretty good. Better to me than Bomonti or R&B (which lately has had a weird bitter flavor in their food... hmm); not as good as Mandy's. Still: CHEAP! Also they delivered pretty quickly. I'll definitely keep them in my rotation.
