The Dor-Stop is my new favorite place to have breakfast narrowly beating out my own kitchen table. I love the eggs the home fries and the friendly but harried service. The Dor-Stop is almost always packed with customers and for good reason. One small quibble: please for the love of all that is holy get rid of the fake-o Mrs. Butterworths and put out some real maple syrup for those tasty pancakes. Really Dor-Stop you're worth it. I believe in you.
