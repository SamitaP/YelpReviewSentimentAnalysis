This restaurant really knows how to cook meat and fish.  The fried calamari (appetizer) was cooked to perfection with a perfect batter and tender beyond belief.  The duck course (entree) was the most tender meat I have ever eaten.  It was probably overly harsh but only gave four stars because the side of risotto and the sauce on the duck didn't blow me away.  The maple panna cotta dessert was also incredible.  It was a custard with a light cookie and cranberry comfit on top phenom.
