I am taking away a star because they don't deliver. If China Taste delivered I could easily see myself eating from here weekly.  This is a hole in the wall in a seedy neighborhood but I just can't get enough.The Chinese food is some of the best I've had.  Typically get the Hunan Shrimp or Schezwan shrimp with a side of pork fried rice. The shrimp are big and taste fresh not frozen . large and cooked perfectly and the veggies are always crisp and not soggy and over done. Also we've had the sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken.  Although the restaurant is tiny and a little run down the food is very good.All the entrees I've ever had were served pipping hot. The restaurant is really nothing pretty and there are a total of 3 tables. The restaurant is tiny.  If you're passing through the Northside check this place out.
