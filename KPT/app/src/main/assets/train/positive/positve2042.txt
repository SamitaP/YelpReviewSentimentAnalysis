I called on Memorial Day and said I was just checking if you're open today. No she snapped we're closed ya jest woke me up! Well with customer service like that I knew this had to be a real diner.And boy oh boy was I right. Hotcakes thick and soft as fresh cookies something called jumbot (which seems to be Pittsburghese for whatever we scraped off the grill but boy is it good) and good luck finding the bottom of a cup of coffee because they'll never let you get low enough to see it.Maybe these aren't the hugest pancakes in town (that honor goes to the MANcakes at Eggs-R-Us in Crafton) but they sure are delicious. Well worth a few minutes' wait for a table.
