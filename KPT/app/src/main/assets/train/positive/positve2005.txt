Stopped in for breakfast today.Pros: -we were seated almost immediately and it was crowded!  -the meals we got were great!Cons:-service was super slow. We waited over 10 minutes for a server to take drink orders after we were seated. I had told my wife that we were going to leave if someone didn't come over in 3 minutes more. It wasn't just our server it seemed like many tables were waiting a long time.
