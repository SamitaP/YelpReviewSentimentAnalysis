I decided to grab dinner on a Saturday night at Quiet Storm. It wasn't packed so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I ordered their Graham Street Tofu sandwich with their 'chorizo' soup and a shampoo soda. The Graham Street Tofu sandwich and soup were very good but the shampoo soda was interesting to say the least and wouldn't order it again. I was nervous I wouldn't get good service after reading some of the reviews but the waiter was friendly and checked in at the right times. I would definitely come back to Quiet Storm since they've got me curious about their other dishes. I also like the laid back vibe of the place bringing me back to Forrest Gump time.
