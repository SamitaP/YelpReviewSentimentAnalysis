I really enjoy going to Bado's. We mostly order the Gourmet Bianco Pizza 4 slice for the two of us with an appetizer and that is more than enough! We draws us there is the pizza and beer. The pizza is always amazing and they have a great selection of beers on tap and in bottles. If you want to taste a beer on tap just ask and they will bring you a little to try. The waitress's working weekends are pretty fantastic. The guys that work during the work are so-so. I don't have any experience with the bartenders as we always sit at a table and eat.The one drawback for me is how it's a bit too family friendly for me. I love children (work with them everyday!) but it seems that families here feel comfortable letting their children do whatever they want. Maybe it's because the environment already seems loud parents feel they can let their children misbehave and it will go unnoticed. I frequent this restaurant and this seems to be he case most weekday evenings and weekends.
