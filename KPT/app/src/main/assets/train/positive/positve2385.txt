This place is like my second home. Not just because of the beer. Not just because of the great food - like hot dogs pizza burgers salads.  But because I just love the atmosphere there. The staff is awesome. The people who eat/drink there are always there to just have a good time while enjoying having a few great beers.I recommend this place for anyone that just wants a beer anyone who loves hot dogs etc.  Their pizza is actually REALLY good.Oh and they have gluten free beers which is good since I don't eat/drink anything with gluten in it!
