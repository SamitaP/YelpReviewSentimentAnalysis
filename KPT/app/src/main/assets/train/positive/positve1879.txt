Any pittsburgher knows the top 3 pizza joints: Beto's Fiori's and Vesuvio's. Beto's is my favourite. I was never a fan of square pizza until I was introduced to this place. I love how they put the cheese on very last & isn't melted when they serve it to you. if you want extra cheese they give you a whole bag of shredded cheese. and it's cheap!! .99 a slice!I can't wait until I'm back in the 'burgh to take my fianc√© there so he can see what real pizza is like.
