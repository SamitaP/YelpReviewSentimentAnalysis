This is sort of a niche place for me. It's a bit too expensive for the average person I think (and yes i understand that it's a co-op etc. but it doesn't change that it's probably middle to upper class prices by comparison) but it does offer some deals. It's the best place to buy spices because they're sold in bulk and if you want to try something new or only need a little for a recipe you don't have to buy a whole bottle. There is an entire aisle of spices spice blends and dried herbs so there is a lot to choose from. It's also great to buy a little at a time because you can make sure your spices are always fresh. Same goes for the bulk food bins though probably half of them are the 9000 flavors of granola they stock.The salad bar has great variety. The hot food bar not so much. It runs out quickly and it's too easy to run up a high tab if the good stuff is weighty. I'm not a fan of most of the packaged fresh food in the deli case. The stuffed grape leaves are not good and a lot of the other things seem sort of bland to me.There's an extensive vitamins and supplements section with pretty much any herbal supplement you'd want. The produce section is expensive but almost always very fresh.
