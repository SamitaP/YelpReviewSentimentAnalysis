Stopped by for lunch and was greeted by great-looking focaccia coming out of the oven. Based on that view I decided to have the eggplant foccacia. It came with homemade Italian wedding soup which was good with fresh veggies.  It also came with delicious bread and seasoned oil for dipping-- excellent!  The eggplant was good but honestly the sun dried tomato and olive tapenade did not enhance the sandwich. It would have rocked with a homemade marinara instead.  The waitress was friendly in a casual way and the atmosphere was warm and contemporary.  I will try something else next time as it is worth a return visit!
