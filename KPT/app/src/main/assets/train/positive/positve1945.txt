I really enjoy Beto's Pizza because it's truly unlike any other pizza you've had! The dough is hot and the toppings are placed on cold! Be careful the car ride home really can make the toppings all melt together which makes the pizza still very good but not as good as the unique tasting cold toppings that you go to Beto's for! The pizza can get pricey with additional pricing for many of the toppings but it is totally worth it! The ingredients are so fresh and the pizza is so yummy!
