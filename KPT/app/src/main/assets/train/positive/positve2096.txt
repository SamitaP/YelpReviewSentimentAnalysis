Great little breakfast place! Portions were perfect not too much not too little.  We were there on a Tuesday morning and it was busy busy I can on l  imagine what a weekend would bring. That being said I would wonder how the wait staff would handle the people because they were not very pleasant.  That took a little away from the experience but not a deal breaker.  We both had pancakes and they were amazing.  The wife had chocolate and banana yummy! I had plain but still a great taste!!For an great little breakfast stop I highly recommend.
