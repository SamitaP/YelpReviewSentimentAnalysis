This really is a great place. It's hard to find fault with anything here! Great owner superb bar food and oh the huge selection of craft beer. And I'm not talking about the massive collection in the beer cave!! The commitment to have 5 or 6 local brews (Helltown included) on tap in a rotating  local draft corner is music to my ears. Had Helltown's Reaper Harvest Ale last night and it was fabulous. I've had quite a few local brews here as well as a selection of other crafts. I love having exciting draft beer choices!The food is really good too! Wings dogs veggie dogs...these aren't just your typical ballpark quality dogs. Nah these are amazing. The buns the all beef dog with that welcome snap when you bite it...yum. Plus the selection of options will keep you coming back to try more and more. The daily specials are worth watching - the 10 wings for $5 on Monday is a bargain!!Since they don't serve cheapo food or beer the price reflects that. 2 draft beers and 2 hotdogs  is close to $25. But hey enjoy it. The crowd is cool the atmosphere is terrific and the beer selection is among the best in the city. I'll keep coming back. For sure!
