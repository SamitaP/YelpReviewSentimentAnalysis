Im a southerner which doesn't qualify me as a born expert on cheese steak. But you don't need an advanced degree to know that this place puts out an absolutely delicious sandwich. I live 1100 miles away but my first (and third and fourth and fifth) stop when I go to Pittsburgh is always Rudy's. I usually avoid meat cheese and white carbs but this definitely merits an exception. I have tried everything and like most all of it but always get the steak and cheese with egg. We never even heard of that back home. Get the smaller one unless you're sharing. I have to take part of the small to go its enormous.I think they've been in the same place for 30 years and never heard about paint. Who cares what it looks like though when its the best thing you ever put in your mouth?
