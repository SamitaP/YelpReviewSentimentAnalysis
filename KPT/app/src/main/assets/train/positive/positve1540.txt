this is hands down the best german restaurant in pittsburgh.It is fantastic although there are two menu items that are inedible.  DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN VIENNESE OR THE GOULASH.I absolutely LOVE this place.  I always get the Sampler Platter and get two knackwurst and a Schnitzel Lichtenstein and then take half of it home.  this review isn't very exciting bc now I'm thinking about how I was Schnitzel Lichtenstein...Listen I grew up a kleine Madchen in Stuttgart Germany.  I know my German food and if you are thinking Hoffbrau Haus you are thinking of just one type of german cuisine.  Aside from when Atria's has their Oktoberfest menu this IS the most authentic German food in Pittsburgh.How good is Max's?It was good enough my German family and I held my sister's rehearsal dinner there.  And they even let us have Polter Abend on the sidewalk outside!  It is good enough we take our father there for Father's Day.If you haven't taken your Dad out to dinner lately you should!  Take him to Max's!Reasonably priced and the interior reminds me a little of eating at my grandmother's house.
