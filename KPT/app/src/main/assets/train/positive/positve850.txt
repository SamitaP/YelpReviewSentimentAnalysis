This is a great place for happy hour to catch the game or to have a small-ish private party. Definitely check out their website for the daily happy hour specials but Mon-Fri from 5-7pm they have $1 off all drafts1/2 Priced Blues Booze$5 Nachos and Quesadillas$5 basket of wings (10 pieces)East End beers are $3 all day every day.The food here is not spectacular but I've always enjoyed what I've gotten. Being from the South I wouldn't think to order the BBQ or catfish here so I can't vouch for those. The spicy wings cheese sticks salads and grilled cheese are all good. The regulars and servers are pretty nice people. We watched the Saint/Steelers game here (with our Saints attire on!) and easily made friends the whole night. They also have a small loft area that you can reserve for free for a private party and you're supplied a waitress for the evening. Finally they deliver! I love having another delivery option besides Chinese and Pizza. Now I can be lazy and eat a big salad!
