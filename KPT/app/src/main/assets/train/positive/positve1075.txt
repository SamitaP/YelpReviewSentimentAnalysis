This is such a fabulous place.  Regardless of the occasion the food and the service are impeccable.  In Pittsburgh trying to find a restaurant that will fit everyone in your parties needs is difficult - Casbah is the spot.  My family had a birthday party for me here on Sunday.  Casbah was accommodating with a cake with a loud bunch that constantly changed their order and were extremely patient.  The food was outstanding as per usual! I ordered the Elysian lamb which was delicious! Cannot wait to return!
