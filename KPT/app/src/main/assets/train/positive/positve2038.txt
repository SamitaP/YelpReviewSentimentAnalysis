Like many others before me I came to the Dor-Stop with high expectations and let me tell you my expectations were exceeded.My girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.The place is classic still has a bar counter kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled.Now lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.I got the pancake breakfast usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.My girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. I recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.Oh and try the potato pancakes they will rock your world.
