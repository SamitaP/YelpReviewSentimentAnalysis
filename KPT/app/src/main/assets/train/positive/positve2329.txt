Awesome beer selection draft and bottles. You can get beer to go. Hot dogs and more bar food type stuff. The fries are double-fried (Belgian style) and plentiful. High points of the sandwich menu: The giant fish the Big Ben cheesesteak (toppings include fries & coleslaw) and the half-pound keilbasa with horseradish brown mustard and sauerkraut. Good pizzas too. The Swissvale Shroom is awesome mushroomy goodness and I love the Popeye's on a whole wheat crust.One big warning: Service is wonky especially if you order both pizza and sandwiches. The pizza kitchen is on a different schedule from the sandwich/dogs kitchen and they make _no_ attempt to coordinate. Pizzas take 30 minutes and dogs take 10-15 so if you order a sandwich and your buddy orders a pizza you'll be finished eating before his food gets there. Down sides: - The burgers are not very good. They come out large and dry. - Service is quirky (as mentioned above). - Gets crowded especially on weekends. They frequently have a seating list in the dining room side but I think the bar side is still grab a table - that's confusing. Beer only though they've opened the loft upstairs that seems to have a full bar - I haven't been there.
