Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not but they taste terrific.  The options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  Definitely recommend giving this a try.
