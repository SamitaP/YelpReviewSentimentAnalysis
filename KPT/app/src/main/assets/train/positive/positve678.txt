In similar fashion to Joseph S. I too decided to give Pino's a shot once we saw how packed nearby Point Brugge which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation was. It was a relatively nice evening and I thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. We were immediately greeted by Jen one of the co-owners as we entered. I made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop and she volunteered some additional information about their production that I found to be very interesting. I really loved the bistro burger. I requested it to be prepared Medium and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times I've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. Nicole our waitress proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. We also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. I thought the ziti was a bit dry but the sauce and cheese were delicious. We really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious and he let me try one of his meatballs which I found to have that homemade flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. Our friend loved her arugula salad and as a seafood aficionado I was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. Our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them. Overall we loved our experience and WILL be back! We were told about Pino's legendary Sunday brunches and I look forward to trying one myself the next Sunday I have off from work.
