Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a First to Review by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a must for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago when I worked on the Northside for Heinz I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  What's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.
