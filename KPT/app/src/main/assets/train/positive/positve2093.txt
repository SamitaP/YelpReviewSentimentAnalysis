I've been going to Dor-Stop for years (well before the DDD crowd arrived).  While I'm thrilled to see Bob and Vicky's crew thriving I do have to say that I miss being able to actually walk-in on a Saturday or Sunday without a line around the block.Irregardless when you're looking for unique spins on traditional diner fare this is your joint.The pancakes are all fantastic.  I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).  I highly suggest the apple walnut banana chocolate chip the oatmeal raisin and most importantly...  PUMPKIN (the best in town).Lori's Raspberry French Toast is the obligatory first dine just stay away from the other iterations that aren't first coated in corn flakes prior to landing on the griddle.The jumbots eggs benedict and potato pancakes all also represent fantastic choices.  If you have a choice of meat hands down get the ham off the bone.One other key note...  Bob Vicky and their daughter Lori go out of their way to make people happy.  They always bring samples out to those waiting for a seat and offer coffee to hold people over when it's cold out.If you're running solo or with one in tow I recommend you check to see if there are spots at the bar (first come first serve).
