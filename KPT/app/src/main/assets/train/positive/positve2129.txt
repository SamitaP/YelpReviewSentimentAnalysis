I'm not ashamed to admit it - I was skeptical.  As a long-time lover of Pamela's I just couldn't see this place making me happy when we discovered Pamela's in the Strip was closed on Memorial Day.  The wait was torturous at the Dor-Stop too...however it was a holiday so I suppose i understand.  And when we did finally get seated the AMAZING hot cakes SUPERB hash browns and perfectly cooked eggs really made my morning!I prefer my hot cakes to be thin and flat and when I saw the ones here I was unsure again.  But the taste will BLOW YOUR MIND.  I got the apple cinnamon ones - they are crispy yet fluffy with apples that taste very fresh and just the right amount of cinnamon.  I even enjoyed the butter as a sweet additive to a decadent treat!  The potatoes were also amazing - true lyonnaise style with crispy outsides warm insides and plenty of onions.  Eggs were standard fair but overeasy is often executed poorly... so props for getting it exactly right.  Several of my friends also ordered different flavors of hot cakes and suggested the oatmeal ones are really not to be missed as well.Despite the long wait and weird waitress we all LOVED our breakfast and I was full for hours after.  YUM!  Can't wait to go back!
