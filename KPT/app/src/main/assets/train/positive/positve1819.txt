I'm underwhelmed. Being a Mike & Tonys kind of girl I was not really expecting a whole lot. But this meal left me feeling totally meh. I've personally made better tzatziki sauce before. Their gyro meat has some flavor but it's way too salty for me. I give it a 3 purely for the fact that their staff is helpful and super nice. That always makes a difference to me. Still it is not going to be enough to make me want to go back. I'm sticking with my original choice!
