I love you Quiet Storm!!  Please open another location in the Los Angeles area stat.  I think the best part about Quiet Storm was rolling in at 10:30 on a Sunday and being seated without a wait.  Are you kidding me?  That's AMAZING!  I was prepared to have to wait for a little bit for Sunday brunch. Quiet Storm has quite possibly the most delicious scrambled tofu that I have ever had.  I have no idea what they do to get the tofu to that texture but its delightful and don't ever change.  I love animal products but I did not miss the meat in any of the dishes that I sampled.  I order the Black & Gold breakfast burrito which was delicious but not half as excited at the Country Gravy burrito my friend had.  The onion gravy is insanely flavorful and made me question why I put animal in my gravy to begin with.  I know its a crazy thought but its true.  I look forward to many additional trips during my extended stay in Pittsburgh.
