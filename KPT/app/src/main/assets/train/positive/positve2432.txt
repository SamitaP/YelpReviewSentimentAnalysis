I absolutely love D's with all of my heart. If you're looking for a plain dog and fries (boring) they have what you want. If you're looking for a Mac n cheese dog or one with bacon and pineapple with sriracha and a side of chili cheese fries they've got you covered too. Add in an enormous draft selection a beer cave 1000 beers deep and just the right game always on and you've got my choice for a Saturday evening. Not to mention pizza for days innovative burgers that'll blow your socks off and CORNDOGS. Just go here be happy.
