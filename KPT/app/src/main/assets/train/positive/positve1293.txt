calzone was good ricotta was xlnt also had buffalo fries arrived soggy - perhaps they should bake/appeared to be deep-fried delivery was right at what they told me when I ordered they're always good with service I've had various pizzas as well I'd order from here again not exceptional but always tasty on-time and good service I'd give 3.5 if I could
