Great bread and excellent customer service!We went in wanting bread to take back home with us but we didn't know what kind to get. We decided to get a couple of rolls and one of the ladies let us have three full size rolls just as samples. I ate the raisin rye right away and it was excellent I'm sure it would be even better toasted.I'd definitely buy my bread here if we lived in Pittsburgh.
