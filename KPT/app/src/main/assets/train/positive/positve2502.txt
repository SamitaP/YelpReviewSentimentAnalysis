I love Dunning's.  When I want a good burger this is the place I visit.  Even when they're busy I can count on getting my burger the way I ordered it.  The portions are HUGE.  The downside is that this place can be noisy and the wine prices are too high for a 4 ounce pour.  Otherwise the service is good the food consistent and the atmosphere pleasant for a neighborhood pub.
