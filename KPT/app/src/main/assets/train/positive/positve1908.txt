My first half cooked Pizza!So I have heard about Beto's for quite some time now. From my main man and Dormont's own Anthony Pecora (now) to my other main man Nick Rockwell who used to play at Dormont park and eat the pizza as a kid.My first imprecision Damn they didn't cook my pie! I have heard a lot about this pizza but know one has ever said anything about a Raw: slice of pizza! But to no avail it was an illusion. It seems as if they cook there pizza and then top it with the toppings....? Strange..? Well yes it is strange to this jedi but Beto's knows what they are doing! The crust is in word umm ahhh AWESOME! Nice and crunhcy light and flaky and also has the moistness of a biscuit.......if that makes any sense. Sauce is also good nothing crazy just good ole pizza sauce. The sauce reminds me of Kiddyland Pizza at Kennywood or it has the feel of Della Sala's Pizza (Verona). I went with my favorite pizza combination Mushroom & Onion. I was excited because they use canned mushrooms and loaded them on. Call me weird but i love canned mushroom on my pizza. Another delight the onion was sliced into rings. Onions HAVE to be sliced into rings for pie....plain an simple. Diced? One pissed of jedi! Like I said before raw toppings so it was a shock to bite into raw cheese and onion. The raw onion went well with the whole Beto's thing they have going on. I was pleased.I will be back to Beto's and it is a great change of pace. I do not know if it is blaspheme to order the pie double cooked but I would like to try that. It would definitely be a knife & fork pie.  * JEDI APPROVED *
