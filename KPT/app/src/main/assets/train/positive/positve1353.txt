I enjoyed this place but wasn't completely wowed.  I was told that it's Portuguese but I'm not seeing what's so Portuguese about it.  Certainly a good Continental restaurant by any means.  I liked the atmosphere and the service was good.  And the food was good too.  But for the price I didn't think the food was THAT great.  I'll come again but it won't be because I'm the one suggesting it.
