I've been wanting to try Bado's for awhile and finally did a few days ago. I didn't want to leave the house though so I thought I'd check out their delivery service. I got a thin crust pizza and the only thing I didn't like was how floppy it was. It ended up being easier to cut it with a knife and fork than to hold it. Not a big deal especially considering how tasty the pizza was! Fresh basil and garlic and the pepperoni was nice and crispy and well cooked. It was an awesome indulgence. Additionally the driver was really personable and my order was at my door in 40 minutes which is a lot faster than I expected on a Friday night! This is definitely going to become a staple of my Pittsburgh food experience!
