If you're visiting Pittsy and you want to find some local flavor served with a side  dish of damned good german food Max's is for you.  I was so happy to come here after a week of hotel/bar/fancy restaurant food...total wonderful german heaven.  I went with the sauerbraten a perennial favorite of mine.  I can't say that Max's was the best I've ever had (cuz mine is the best I've had) but it was damn good.  And the sauerkraut! and potato pancakes! and the beer served in mason jars!  It was fun and fantabulous!  Great friendly servicee with personality.  As many schnitzels on the menu as you can imagine (my co-worker had schnitzel with an egg anchovy and capers on top if you can imagine).I didn't order the corned beef meatballs ...I can not believe they make such a thing.
