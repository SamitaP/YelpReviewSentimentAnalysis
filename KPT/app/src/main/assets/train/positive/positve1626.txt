I'm a huge fan of Breadworks. It's about a mile from my front door so I visit there about once a week to stock up. Since discovering this place I haven't bought bread at any other store or bakery. First it smells AMAZING when you walk in the very tiny storefront. Depending on the day of the week and time of day this place gets crowded! The best time to go is right when they open at 6:30 am it's the only way to assure that they haven't run out of your favorites. This happens often especially with the whole wheat which is downright incredible. They have everything from smaller hard rolls sourdough and salt sticks baguettes larger loaves of pretty much every kind of bread you can think of. They even have featured breads daily such as raisin walnut and cheddar focaccia. And the best part is it's CHEAP!! Crazy cheap! Only negative is the employees are not thrilled to be there as a whole most seem almost annoyed most of the time especially if you don't know what you want immediately upon walking in the door. It's a small price to pay to get in on the Breadworks action!
