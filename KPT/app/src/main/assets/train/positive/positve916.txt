I have to say I maybe (/definitely) had these guys programmed into my phone when I lived over in Shadyside. I term this branch Good Ole Faithful as they have come to my aid during many times of need which possibly includes Saturday nights at 2am (sorry for having to deal with me guys). The pizza is freakin cheap and pretty damn good especially for the price. I maybe (/definitely) use to call them every Monday when they had an extra-large one-topping pizza AND an order of bread sticks for only 9.99...... 9.99! I'm not sure that they still run this deal but I could generally get a large cheese for about 10 bucks and you can't really beat that. Not too greasy just enough but not too much cheese their pizza (and actually other food items which is surprisingly quite extensive) is better than average and tasty for a night in alone or stumbling in with friends after a night out. I usually just walked over where's it's perfectly nestled in the shopping center across from Mad Mex and Buffalo Blues on S. Highland- however they deliver too- and both options are surprisingly quick. Enjoy!
