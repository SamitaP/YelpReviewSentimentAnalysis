Any place that has a walk-in fridge full of beer gets my vote.  Go visit the beer cave!D's is one of those places I need to go to every time I'm back in town visiting family.  I usually go for a burger or wings (seriously I need to find good wings in LA...) and beer.  The food is always tasty and the service is excellent.  Regent Square is a really cute little area that has a ton of great bars and restaurants.  Highly recommended.
