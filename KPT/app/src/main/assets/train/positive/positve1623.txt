No frills no fake smiling employees just REALLY GREAT BREAD. Fresh authentic all natural ingredients and very good prices. I regularly buy 2 baguettes here for a $1.25 or $1.50. Lots of rolls breadsticks rye wheat and focaccia. It's a small store at the bakery prices are a lot lower than at Wholey's or somewhere else in the city. Many restaurants use breadworks. Great stuff.
