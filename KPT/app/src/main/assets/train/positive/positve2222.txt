We love this place for some reason.  We've been to India Garden Taj Mahal Tamarind and Flavor of India.  I'll admit that sometimes it's really great and sometimes it's just good seems to depend who is doing the cooking.  The service is pretty much non existent which I'm fine with don't have to leave a tip!  So for $9 or so you get a nice lunch or dinner buffet with mango lassi pop and chai tea included.
