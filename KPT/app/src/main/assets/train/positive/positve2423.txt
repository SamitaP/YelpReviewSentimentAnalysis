This was another place that came highly recommended while we were in town and this place also didn't not disappoint! The food was good.  The dogs were tasty and they had some interesting recipes but let's cut to the chase....the beer selection is massive! Being from Michigan we are spoiled with craft beers from our fine state but with that comes the desire to try other state's craft beer selection and D's had a solid selection of PA brews.  For one the beer cooler had a good sized selection but it's all about the hundreds of warm beers they have in the back of the restaurant.  They have pretty much anything you want back there and it doesn't' matter that it's warm because they have a beer chiller where you can put your beers in there until optimal temperature.   It only takes about 7 minutes and they are good to go as well.  Needless to say this is another recommendation that I will pass on to all friends heading to Pittsburgh.  I'll spare the beer reviews as there's another app for that.
