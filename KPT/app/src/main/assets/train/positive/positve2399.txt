Generally I like D's I. The restaurant itself has a cozy feel to it and their large beer cave is one of the few places where I can get some of my favorite import beer.  Note the Czechs make more than just Pilsner Urquell. Je to pravda! Most of the staff are very friendly and the managers are always quick to help if you need assistance.  Some of you may get angry with me but I simply cannot review D's I without comparatively rating it against its sister restaurant D's II in Monroeville.  And no I couldn't possibly care less that the latter is in an old Pizza Hut.  That's right I prefer D's II to D's I. Hear me out.  First of all D's I' drafts are all about a dollar more expensive than those in the suburbs.  Why the upcharge? Also after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square.  No wraps no steak salad no variety of sandwiches.  I will say that the food they do serve is good.  I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering.  D's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar.  Fine.  It's a smaller location and it stays true to its original beer bar theme.  Sometimes however I like to mix it up.  And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location.  Obviously I's beer cave trumps II's beer... um... outcove? So all of that warrants a four-star rating.  Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart I'm docking a star for closing so early.  Even when there is a crowd the staff closes at 11:00 (Su-W) or 12:00 (Th-Sat) on the DOT.  That's just not responding to demand!Overall I don't dislike D's I.  Quite the contrary.  After all three stars means A-OK.  But to me D's Regent Square doesn't go beyond that.
