WOW! I really don't know what else to say. Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had from a restaurant.We were looking for a good breakfast place on Saturday and I found this one on Yelp. The reviews were great and the pictures looked so good that we had to give it a try. Thank you yelpers for helping me find this gem!I had the Jumbot Guy style. It was so good I HAD to eat the whole thing. Which was no easy feat considering how big of a plate it was. A heaping plate of everything but the kitchen sink. Eggs hash browns pepper jack cheese onions peppers hot sausage and more! On top if that my boyfriend and I had to try a specialty pancake as well. Luckily you can get just one. We had the apple cinnamon cake and it was absolutely heavenly. Crispy on the outside with a doughy yet done center. It melted in your mouth!He had the regular breakfast with the potato pancakes which The Dor-stop is apparently known for. I didn't get a chance to try them since he demolished it in mere minutes. I'm assuming they were delicious. It was reasonably priced and very cute. We were fortunate enough to get a table right away but I've heard there can be a pretty long wait. Sometimes out the door which makes perfect sense after tasting this delicious food.
