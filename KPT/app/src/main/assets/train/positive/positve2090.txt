Heard about this place from Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. Great breakfast place for decent prices. Portions were huge. Got the eggs benedict and banana chocolate chip pancakes. Pancakes were a little too sweet and was sickening after a while but benedict was delicious. The ham was extremely large and juicy. The eggs perfect sunny side up (I love it when you stab the yolk and it runs all over the food). I liked that they used some kind of toast instead of regular English muffins. The hollandaise sauce was rich and buttery maybe a little bit too rich.
