Odd.... I'd say it's not bad but it's not good either. Super sloppy and there's far better pizza elsewhere. The dining room atmosphere is weird... It's like where Sugar Bear took June on their date to the cafeteria but without fluorescent lights. Plastic forks plastic knives and paper plates with crying kids and no beer.  I'll pass next time.
