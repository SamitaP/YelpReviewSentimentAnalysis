I have been to The Dor-Stop numerous times and never been disappointed. They are known for their pancakes as featured on The Food Network's Diners Drive-ins and Dives. I always get pancakes when I go and my favorites are banana walnut and pumpkin. These pancakes are thick and fluffy and so filling! I always end up taking at least one home. My husband has also tried their french toast which he highly recommends. They get busy during the peak breakfast/brunch hours so a wait is sometimes necessary but they move fast with service without rushing you and you get out quick.  It has your basic diner feel. It is clean and service has always been warm and friendly. Prices are very reasonable in my opinion as my husband and I both eat for under $20. I love the Dor-stop and highly recommend it to others!
