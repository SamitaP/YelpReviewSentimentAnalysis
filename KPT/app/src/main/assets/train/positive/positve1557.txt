I have a confession to make........the thing I like most about Max's is their bread!!! They are free....they are fresh made....hot and soft...different kinds....and so so delicious!I'm not a big fan of German food but it's just my personal taste. The portions are large and atmosphere is very relaxing and casual. I like it.
