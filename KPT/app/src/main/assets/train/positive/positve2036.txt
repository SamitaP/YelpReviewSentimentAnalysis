If you ever need an explanation of what a bottomless cup of coffee truly signifies check out the Dor-Stop.In addition to that lesson the you will experience the following:-Hotcakes so good you don't need to add syrup (mine were oatmeal raisin like eating the amazing hybrid of a cookie and pancake)-Potato pancakes so good that you'll wish you had multiple orders-Slabs of ham. So good.Add in the great service ease to find parking and decent prices and this place is truly a gem. Don't let the wait scare you unless you have a large group - people flow out of there pretty quickly and for 2 people on a Sunday we only had to wait 10 minutes (and they gave us free samples while we waited). And it is definitely worth the wait.
