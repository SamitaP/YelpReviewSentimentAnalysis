Pizza Parma has many of the characteristics I like in a pizza joint. 1) They deliver when they say they will 2) Diverse menu and toppings 3) Coupons 4) Online ordering and 5) Take credit cards. I think Pizza Parma shines with their specialty pizzas. Artichoke Buffalo Chicken Spinach & Feta and Greek pies are all delicious. I've also had some of their pasta dishes and I can't complain. It's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge and they come with bread and a salad. Pizza Parma fails on wings though. The texture is unappealing (aka flappy chicken skin-- yuk!) and the sauces lack depth. Desserts are also not worth the buy.
