When owners name a restaurant like this take the hint!  They didn't name this place Six Pax & Hummus!  Come here for beer and dogs.  There are other things on the menu but the stars of the show are in the name.So let's talk dogs first.  Each one is going to cost you $4-$5 and they are large delicious and messy.  You definitely want to be among friends when you eat one of these bad boys and have plenty of napkins.  If you are only eating dogs many folks order two.  Every topping imaginable is available.  Another popular choice is one dog and excellent fries.  Add a craft beer or two and you have one heck of a fine casual meal.Speaking of craft beers the selection here is excellent.  I appreciate that the names are up on an easy to read board that includes the ABV%.  If you are new to craft beers many of them are very strong.  Let's say you normally drink three or four Coors Lights and now you are discovering the pleasure of Delirium Noel.  It's a 10% beer and if you drink three or four you are in for a big surprise!  In the interest of safe driving for everyone be aware of the ABV%.So the food is great and the beer is excellent and I've found the service to also be right on.  These folks are extremely popular so at peak times it's mobbed.  Do yourself a favor and show up off peak and you'll eat and drink much more quickly.
