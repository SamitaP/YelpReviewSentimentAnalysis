(I'm 29 and have been a vegetarian for 17 years)For vegetarian food in Pittsburgh I say this place is aces. But compared to the many other veggie restaurants I've been to in this past this place is average. It's really hit and miss with their dishes. When at a veggie place I usually try to change it up each time I go to keep my diet varied. This has proven to be a little difficult at Quiet Storm because it seems every other time I get something I don't like. Apple Panini is amazing. Nachos are great! Curry wasn't spicy enough. Grits runny. Milkshakes YUM! I feel like the cooks don't have a good handle on cooking tofu there. Different dishes require tofu to be cooked for different lengths of time and it different sauces and it has always tasted bizarre when I get it there. Sometimes its not pressed and cooked long enough. Sometimes its dried out! How can tofu get dried out? This is coming from someone who LOVES tofu. I can eat silken tofu straight out of the package with a little soy sauce and sugar.If you have spent anytime in Portland Oregon... the atmosphere in this place is very Portland. Outdoorsy hipster cafe style. It's loud but I couldn't imagine it another way. They also have pinball which is awesome. We haven't taken advantage of this but they do have board games and books available as well.
