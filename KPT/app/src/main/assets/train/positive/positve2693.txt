Came in here just reading some reviews figured I'll give it a shot they were good.I walked in to an empty restaurant and was worried but the owner Frank was there to greet me and how pleasant he was. He saw the concern on my face and brought me over to family pictures showing how long the restaurant has been in business and has been a success.So not knowing what to order because so many things looked yummy he suggested the Pork Chop Florentine OMG!!! DELICIOUS!!!AND he prepared it himself!I definitely highly recommend dining here when in the Pittsburgh/Greentree area.The reason for 4 starts not 5 the wine choices are lacking but the Red Rock Malbec was nice with the meal. And Stephanie the bartender super sweet and makes you feel like you're a regular.Great place!!!
