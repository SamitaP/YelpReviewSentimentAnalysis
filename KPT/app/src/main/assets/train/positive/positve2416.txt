I'm subleasing an apt across the street and have been in a few times now.  Hot dogs are good and cheap but the burger options although still good are close to $10 each.  Nice draft selection but also pricy.  Their happy hour is $1 off drafts 4p-6p everyday so that's still $4-5 for a beer.  I'll be back though.
