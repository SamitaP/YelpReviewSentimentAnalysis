I had dined at Namaste a couple of times at its old location.  The new spot in the otherwise depressing Days Inn is a breath of fresh air.  I have already dined there three times since the January 1 2013 opening.  One walks into another world when entering this restaurant from the hotel.  It is modern clean attractive spacious and comfortable.  The food is delicious and selection of items is satisfactory though I wish there was more broccoli and cauliflower and breaded vegetables all of which are offered at other area restaurants. Breaded cauliflower would be wonderful. The price is extraordinary for the quality and quantity $6.99 for lunch $8.99 for dinner the lowest in the region.  Worthy of special mention is the carrot pudding offered sometimes: delicious. I hope the place will survive.  It has not been anything close to busy or filled on any of my visits the same as was the case at the former location. The individuals that serve and manage the restaurant are generally not friendly something which I do not understand.  I am pleasant; I walk into a restaurant with a smile and treat the staff with respect.  I tip well.  To be treated with disdain is a mystery to me.
