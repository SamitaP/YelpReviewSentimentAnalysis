Meh is kind of how I felt about this place which I realize is an opinion that seems to go against the grain. I had heard about D's time and time again. Everyone talked about it like it was the greatest place in existence. I had such high expectations! I suppose maybe I was expecting too much which led to some disappointment. A few friends and I went here on a Friday night and it was (predictably) packed. We were fairly lucky to get a table almost right away. I obviously had to acknowledge that the beer selection is impressive. If you can't find it here you probably can't find it anywhere in Pittsburgh. I had to check out the famous Beer Cave which seemed to have just about everything. I think I'll make it a point to pick up some brews here next time I'm looking for something unusual or new.I wish I had more to say but I just wasn't feeling it. My friends love it so I'm sure I'll be back and next time I'll make it a point to try the food. Judging by some of the other reviews that might change my perception of the place.
