There aren't many places in Pittsburgh where you can get an above average large cheese pizza for $9. They also have a traditional pizza place menu with salads hoagies breadsticks pastas and munchies. The cheesesticks are great when you're craving something cheesy and salty and their grilled chicken salad with fries and ranch dressing is dependable as well. One great thing about this place is that you can stop in and grab a slice or two if you're in a hurry. This place is right along my way home from the bus from work so I'm always tempted to stop here.If you're looking for a great place to grab an inexpensive pizza check out Pizza Perfectta!
