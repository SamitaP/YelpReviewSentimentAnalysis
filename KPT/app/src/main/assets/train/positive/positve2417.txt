While I'm not much of a beer fan I appreciate that this place would appeal to both the beer snob and the casual drinker. Enormous selection of beers in the Cave as well as on tap. They have Arsenal Cider which makes me very happy (although I wish they carried the Bone-Dry). The hot dogs and fries are amazing. I had an Angry Tiki. It sounded like an odd combination - pineapple hoisin sauce and bacon on a hot dog - but it was delicious. The only thing I might change next time is asking for a side of Sriracha (would have put this hot dog over the top). It's cheap it's a good set-up for going with a group and I will definitely take any of my beer-loving friends here.
