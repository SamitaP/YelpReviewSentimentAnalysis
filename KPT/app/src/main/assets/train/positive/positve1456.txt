This is my favorite restaurant EVER- the food is amazing I will echo that the meatball appetizer is yummy veal chop fantastic and HUGE my favorite dinner choice is the veal del monzu with pine nuts lemon and crab- of course the pasta is amazing with the vodka sauce and oil and dont leave without trying the raspberry tiramisu which is like heaven in your mouth-
