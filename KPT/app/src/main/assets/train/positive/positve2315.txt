D's is the 'it' place for Pittsburgh... especially for those that like beer. There are several Belgian pubs around Pittsburgh but D's is a whole different experience. Yes the cave is like a candy shop. The cave is located in the back of the left side. The first time I went (after reading Yelp reviews) I was a little intimidated to head straight past the bar. It's not like BevMo so don't expect to save a lot on a six pack but if you're interested in sampling and trying out different craft or imported beer it's the place. Plus who can resist a cheap filling hot dog?Hm.. hungry. I'm going there now.
