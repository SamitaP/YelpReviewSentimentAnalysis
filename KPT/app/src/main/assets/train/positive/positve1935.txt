As a lifelong devotee of Chicago deep dish pizza I was a bit skeptical when my uncle took me here on a trip to Pittsburgh a few years ago. Cheese is supposed to be melted I thought. Sure enough the pizza was great. Enough to win me over even. The crunchy crust combined with the warm sauce and cold cheese piled high was like nothing I've ever had before. When I came into town again this past month Beto's was my first stop. Do go here.
