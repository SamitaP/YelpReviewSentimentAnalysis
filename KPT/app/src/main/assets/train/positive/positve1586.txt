Best German food in the Burgh.  Hands down.  In the heart of Deutschtown Pittsburgh's historically German/Austrian enclave this is real German cuisine- heavy delicious and traditional.The schnitzels are amazing and the brats are pretty good.  Max's is far and away better than the breweries or chain theme restaurants.  The place is quiet  to be sure.  If you're looking for dancers in lederhosen and want to sing drinking songs go elsewhere.  This place is all about the food.  And it is worth a trip.
