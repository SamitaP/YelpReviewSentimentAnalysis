Another Northside neighborhood favorite! Although the physical structure and ambiance leave a bit to be desired. The food and staff surely make up for it!  The staff is always super friendly even when you stroll in late in the evening a glass or two of wine into your night. The food is all house made and truly delicious! The Virginia spots are one of my personal favorites. Honesty anything you try you'll be sure to love.It is BYOB but beware of the corkage fee per person.
