The hot sausage is the best I think I've ever had...I know that is a very bold statement but I stand behind it ;-)  This place has been in the same location for like 30 years so they're doing something right (and with no advertising!).  Love the sidewalk stand-great if you don't have a lot of time for lunch (& you can pay outside). My only suggestion would be for them to sell extra sauce (extra .50 maybe) with the hot sausage.  Otherwise this spot is awesome & the people are super friendly :-)
