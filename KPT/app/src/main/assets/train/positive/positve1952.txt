Darren it cracked me up to see you reviewed this Eat'n Park but then I wasn't surprised a bit. I used to live blocks away from this place and the location was ideal for my favorite bar ever (Wilkie's Inn now closed) was diagonally across the street from it. I actually have mostly bad memories of drunken friends fighting and/or confrontations here but still this place beats all after a night at the bar. I can close my eyes and picture scrambled eggs and french toast not to mention their delicious burgers with a side of pickles. And of course the obligatory Eat'n Park smiley face cookies ah how I love them! Message to non-Pittsburghers go to this (or any) Eat'n Park at least once! You'll be back!
