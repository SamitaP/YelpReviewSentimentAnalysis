I can't review the service because I ordered take out but oh. My. Goodness my food. I ordered the fried chicken and I can honestly say that I've never picked apart chicken like that before. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough. It was juicy inside and so crispy on the outside. The fries that came along with the chicken were decent but the fried chicken outshines them so much. It came with coleslaw as well but it wasn't anything special. Standard coleslaw mix. Anything that was wrong with the rest of the food I received was immediately forgiven when I started eating the chicken. I also got the cheese sticks which are never a disappointment. I can't stop raving about the chicken though.... GO. EAT CAIN'S FRIED CHICKEN! NOW!
