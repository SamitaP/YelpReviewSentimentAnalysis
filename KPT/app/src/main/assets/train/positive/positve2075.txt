Still craving their pancakes. It's been weeks. The price is decent for a diner maybe a little pricier but I'm pretty sure I'd name my first born after this place. The service is quick and friendly and you get seated pretty fast so no worries! I tried their sandwiches and they were pretty killer but the pancakes. The pancakes. I dream about the doughy melt to the top of your mouth sugary meal.  It is food deserving of the gods. Then again I'm partial to breakfast.
