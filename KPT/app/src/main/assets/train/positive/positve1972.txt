The best food from any bar I've been to in the 'Burgh!  Everything I've had on the menu has been fantastic and I've eaten there quite a bit. My favorite is a tie between the Chicken Quesadilla and the Bavarian Club.  You wont go home hungry...a lot of food for a good price.  The wings are awesome and the beer selection is absolutely top notch. Over 30 beers on tap...if you like beers that most bars don't carry you definitely want to check this place out. Definitely worth checking this place out. You won't be disappointed.
