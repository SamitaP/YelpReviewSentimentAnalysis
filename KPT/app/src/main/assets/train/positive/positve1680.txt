This restaurant is a gem. Wanted to check out another neighborhood in Pittsburgh. To an ignorant outsider North Side didn't seem much more sketch than South Side or Oakland. After picking up two bottles of red at Wine and Spirits on Ohio Street my team and I got a table at the warm homey Legends of the North Shore where it's BYOB. For appetizers we ordered the margherita bruschetta (best choice) fried polenta and greens 'n beans (mainly because we went on a Tuesday when they had a special deal for 99 cents with any entree). The focaccia bread is great with the homemade mixture of olive oil and herbs. I ordered the mussels bianca over linguine--terrific. Also comes with shrimp. The portions are generous but delicious in part because it's clear that the tomato sauces are all made fresh and in-house. I tried my coworkers gnocchi--good but I was quite satisfied with my own dish. My coworker who ordered the eggplant parmigiano really enjoyed her dish as well.
