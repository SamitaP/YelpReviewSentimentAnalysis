Ok  I have lived here in Pittsburgh most of my life  And I LOVE Pizza.Beto's is a Pittsburgh Icon but defiantly nowhere near the top pizzeria.But you have to have your Beto's FIX once in a while.I usually get 4 cut's with Pepperoni  and you  get your money's worth. Plenty of Pepperoni & Cheese. If you do not like the un-melted cheese  wait a little  it will melt.As for you pretentious types  Pizza is NOT a health food. If you need a Salad  maybe go back to California and eat your wheat grass.I Like Beto's and I will recommend it to folks  Just not every week !
