This is my favorite restaurant in the world. I love it substantially more than any Italian restaurant I have frequented in Italy. If there's a special occasion to celebrate it's done here no questions asked. Everything on the menu is phenomenal and the service is phenomenal as well. The restaurant itself is very intimate and cozy and there is valet available so the fact that it's in a sketchy neighborhood matters not. The bar upstairs is nice but dining downstairs is something else as you can watch your food being prepared. Make sure you visit on an empty stomach as you will be served multiple courses! The vodka pasta you are given is AMAZING. You also get salad and bread with two dips/oil. Entrees are well-sized and you'll probably have the leftovers ever after gorging on all of the mini meals that come before the entree. I do not eat beef... until i go to alla famiglia and order the meatball appetizer. That's saying something so don't forget to order it. My mum gets some hunk of beef (sorry I don't even really look at beef/pork options) every time we go and I can hear her making moaning noises as she chews and then she talks about how to die for it was afterward. I usually get a seafood dish whatever it may be at the time and it is always one of the greatest things I have and will ever eat. I want my final meal to be from Alla Famiglia. Please. I don't care if it costs a car payment or two or three.
