I have been a patron of Bado's several times now and this is a great spot to have few beers watch a game and meet up with friends.  Their beer selection is commendable and is frequently updated.  I have sat a the bar and had a table.  I've never had a problem with service.  Staff is knowledgeable and makes great suggestions.  Now for the food...their pizza is so yummy!  I love everything about it. The cheese sauce toppings...all great.  Their wings are also good.  It can get quite packed during a game or on a weekend evening so there can be a wait.  Grab a beer and wait b/c it's worth it.
