One of the best Italian subs you can get!  After many years of having the TB&G on my list of must go to places was able to stop by and get some take out.  Fun to watch the staff of about 4 making the sandwiches. Just get in line and order when it is your turn.  The 26 inch Italian was so tasty with lots of meat and the sweetness of the Italian dressing.   The place was jumping with people in line and all the tables and bar full of people eating one of the great sandwiches.
