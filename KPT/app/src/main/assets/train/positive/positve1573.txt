Why you should trust my review: I am German. I've been to Germany. I LOVE German food. And German beer. The bar is awesome. Wish we had more time just to chill and drink. But our waitress was awesome attentive and knowledgeable! Order a REAL beer. Something on tap from Germany. (If not I'll give you dirty looks from behind my coffee cup.)What you should order: The Sampler Platter. Pick three amazing entrees two awesome sides. Brilliant for $16.95... best deal on the menu. And if they have a meatball appetizer you want this. You do. So which entrees:  - Schnitzel. Whichever one you're drooling over. Personally Jager Schnitzel is always best because God blessed the world when he made mushrooms and man praised God by making mushroom sauce. - Leberkase. Wow. This was fantastic. It's like a cross between liverwurst (but NOT made with liver) and a meatloaf. Fantastisch. - Weisswurst. It was good. I've had better and yes I know its a German faux pas to have weisswurst at any other time of day than a midmorning snack... however. it was still yummy and I happily moaned with each bite i consumed with mustard.So which sides:  - Spaetzle! Buttery goodness. Never had it or heard of it? Think little dumplings. In butter. Es ist wunderbar. - Sauerkraut... they make theirs with sausage. what?! Ja... mmmmm. - Potato Pancakes. You order these with applesauce. you hear me? applesauce.What to avoid... that's pretty harsh but they lost a star for a reason: - German Potato Salad was too sweet and soupy. My great grandma's recipe puts this to shame. - IF you don't like mustard (weirdo) the Sauerbraten has a mustard sauce. I like it but others don't. You've been warned.We walked here from the ballpark... took about 15 minutes. Worth the walk both ways and they treated us well despite me wearing a Cardinals shirt in a foreign land.Danke!
