First I'll start off with the homemade beer.  Nothing spectacular but it has flavor and is very reasonably priced as is the menu.  I went with the potato pancake Reuben.  HOLY CRAP.  Probably the most filling meal I've ever ate but it was worth it.  My boyfriend was pretty happy he got to finish my leftovers.  The German potato salad I had for my side was equally as good.  It had a bit of a bite to it which I really liked.  I also had to try my boyfriends meal.  He went with one of the wursts but the exact name is escaping me.  It was made with veal and was so light and tender - YUM.  That will be my meal when we return.  I can't believe it took me so long to eat here!
