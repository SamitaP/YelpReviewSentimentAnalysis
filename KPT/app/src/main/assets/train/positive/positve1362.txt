Great food! The meal starts off with their corn bread (not like the corn bread you get in the south) which is delicious. We've gotten a variety of entrees including a delicious salmon dish a quail special and the lamb burger all of which were delicious. The restaurant is BYOB which makes up for the entree cost. I highly recommend a great meal in a small unassuming location.
