This is such a fantastic place to buy your groceries!The store in on the smaller side but they are well stocked with lots of fresh vegetables fruits and other organic treats. I LOVED the fact that many of their items are local especially the delicious bread!Everybody was also very nice and helpful. Great place to come check out if you haven't yet.
