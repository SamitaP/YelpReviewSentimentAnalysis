Either you get it or you dont.  The cold cheese might sound weird the toppings being cold might not sound good just shut up and try it.  This pizza is unlike any you've had before but if you like pizza it is a must have.  I dont make a trip to Pittsburgh with out stopping by Betos.  The toppings are plentiful the cheese is ridiculous and the crust is super crispy.  Love this place.
