Did you ever go somewhere and eat something and think Alright this is good I'm not blown away but alright...  Ok then did you ever realize that months later you're still thinking about something you ate there?  And then you start to think Hey maybe that was better than ok since I'm still thinking about it...It's kind of like a movie that you're luke warm on until you realize that you're still thinking about the movie two days later and then you're like Actually I guess the movie was better than I thought because I'm still thinking about it two days later.   Yeah this place is kind of like that.  We went there back in October.  We had just driven about 6 hours from Jersey to Pittsburgh we got in kind of late and hungry and decided to get something to eat here because it was so close to our hotel (and I did not want to get back in the car and drive somewhere.) They had a good drink special (a couple of dollars for a margarita) and we got sandwiches and burgers.  Nothing amazing but they hit the spot.  But here's the part I'm still thinking about... they had a special that included the option of sweet potato tater tots.   Sweet Potato... Tater Tots.  Is that redundant?  Should it be Sweet Tater Tots?  I don't know but I do know they were willing to substitute them with my sandwich even though I wasn't getting the special.  And I do know they were goood.  So now I'm a 6 hour drive away it's two months later and I'm still thinking about those Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  And for that I'm giving this place 4 stars.  SoHo is really close to PNC Park and not too far from Heinz Field.  They also deliver (room service) to the two hotels right there Spring Hill Suites and Residence Inn.  Ask for the sweet potato tater tots.As for me I'm left wondering if sweet potato french fries (the more common menu cousin of the Sweet Potato Tater Tot) can ever truly be an adequate substitute or if I need to go out and buy myself some sweet potatoes and try to tot them myself...
