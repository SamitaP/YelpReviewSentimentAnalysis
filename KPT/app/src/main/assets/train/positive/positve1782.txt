This is an unassuming place on the North Side - close to the Mattress Factory. But walking in the door you are hit with a wall of smokiness (the rib kind) and you know this is a serious place. The owner Mr Wilson is a quiet man of few words. You have 2 choices - ribs or chicken. Ribs come in small plate large plate or full rack. Then you can add on sides and soda at about $1 each. I went with a small group and we filled ourselves silly on ribs and sides. Very good sauces. The small plate of ribs is *very* filling for lunch. As others have said the decor is nothing to write home about. But there are a few tables. Most of the business when we were there was take-out which I will definitely be returning to do.
