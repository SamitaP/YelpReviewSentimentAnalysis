Have heard that Cain's serves a mean breakfast.   Sure enough they do!A large menu to select from and a Bloody Mary bar.  Many big groups and families chowing down.  It was crowded but when we walked in there was an empty table.  Service was pretty good.  It did take a little while for the food to come out but the place as packed and we were not in any hurry.  My fritata was good and the home fries were good too.Just get there before noon if you want breakfast.
