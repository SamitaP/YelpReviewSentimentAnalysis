I love N.Y. style pizza.  Could eat it every day.  On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:Fiori'sPizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)Pizza PerfecttaAiello's (Murray Street)Beto'sSave for Beto's I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.Pizza Perfectta has a few stools and a counter but really it is a take-out place.
