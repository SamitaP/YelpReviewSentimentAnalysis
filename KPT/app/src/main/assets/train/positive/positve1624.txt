We didn't order directly from them so I'm not ranking any lower than three stars.HOWEVER our wedding catering sourced their bread from Breadworks and it was quite unimpressive.  In fact many of our guests identified it as the one thing they would have changed about our meal...Not sure if it was because our reception was on a Saturday and maybe the hotel only takes deliveries on weekdays or something but it just wasn't fresh-tasting and certainly wasn't on-par with say Mancini's.
