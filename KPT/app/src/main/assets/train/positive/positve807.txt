It was a bit out of the way of where we were staying but I was swayed by the Yelp reviews!  You did not steer me wrong. A nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood Enrico's was the perfect spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed.  My wife and I both got lattes and pastries and everything was good to go.It looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there rooted to a chair.  We got the next to last free table.  Almost every two-top had only one person sitting at it.  I would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes. Recommend!P.s. I thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here.
