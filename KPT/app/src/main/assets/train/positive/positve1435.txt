TOTALLY  one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!!  Food and service was just amazing.  The quality of the dishes was better than we had even in New York City.This is definitely a restaurant to bookmark and remember for the ages.  Reminds me of the old style Italian restaurants that used to be in Bloomfield when that area was just a horrid place to go.  Well Alla Famiglia is in the Allentown area which is not a neighborhood of choice.  Yes your car is guarded in a private secure lot!!Get over the location this is the gem of gems!  Old style design in a charming old building with copper and huge fans.  The kitchen is right there for you to watch and its worth watching this chef do his thing!  The dishes come out hot no waiting the service staff is like a tag team and they all share duties to get the food to you once its ready.The quality of the food was impeccable and the 5 course presentation was really enjoyable...  Oh and dessert was to die for; Belgium chocolate gelato in a fresh waffle cone and the creamiest NY cheesecake you ever had with a hint of orange zest...
