While everyone goes here for the dogs the pizza is not be ignored. Hand tossed crusts with a nice selection of specialty pizzas. Appetizers are good as well. Hummus is a solid choice. Not a fan of their wings. Beer selection is on point and if you can't find what you want on tap head into the beer cave. I like that you can find a crazy variety and try new beers. Always busy so be prepared to wait.
