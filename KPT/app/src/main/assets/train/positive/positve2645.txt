Beer selection: 4.5 starsFood: 3.5 starsThis location is my favorite mostly because it doesnt seem to get quite as busy as the other ones iv been to. As with all Mad Mex's the draft beer list is always great with a broad range of styles. Youre sure to find a beer youre in the mood for.. And happy hour is hard to beat with half off drafts and wings from 4:30-6:30pm on weekdays. The burritos seem to be a hit but i think theyre overrated. The nacho grande is huge and loaded and shall i also mention quite tasty. Wings are pretty decent as well especially with their blue cheese. All in all id say come here for happy hour to feel the full affect of Mad Mex!
