The food is always sort of room temperature but it's delicious! There's a cave. Of beer. There's always a longish wait to get a seat but I can say they do their best to accommodate. My first time here we had a large group and failed to call ahead yet they found somewhere to put us and took good care. This area of town is adorable and I'm looking forward to heading out in the spring time and enjoying some hot dogs in the warm air!
