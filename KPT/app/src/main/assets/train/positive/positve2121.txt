Stopped by this place as we were in Pittsburgh for the day. We went in for brunch and there was a long line of people waiting. We were told that the wait would be 20 minutes so we put our names down and stepped outside to kill some time. When we came back 20 mins. later we were told that they had called our names 5 mins. ago but the hostess was nice enough to tell me that she would seat us next. I ordered the oatmeal walnut pancakes with a side of sausages. The pancakes were really good and I was pleasantly surprised since I didn't know what to expect.The only reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is that when we were done eating and ready to pay our waitress all of sudden brought me a pancake and said there was a shortage of pancakes so she was sorry. I thought it was a bit deceptive on her end for not mentioning this to me earlier when she served us our food.Because when we received our food I thought it was strange that I only received two stacks of pancakes but didn't question it thinking that since it was a specialty pancake I was suppose to only get two. It couldve been an honest mistake but I still felt that she should have mention this to me earlier.
