I think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best I've ever had in fact I never even cared for them until trying Tazza D'oro's. I still hold their teas in high regard. However the food here sucks. They've always had a limited sandwich menu but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. I am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich especially in combination with caffeine. Even though Enrico's is an easy walk from my home I find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn. With a new lunch joint in the 'hood (Park Bruges) why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle?
