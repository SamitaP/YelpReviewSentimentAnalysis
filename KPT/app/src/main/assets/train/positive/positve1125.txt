I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry what is it I'm reviewing here?The Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten) I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning get the Nothin' Fancy and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that they are as vegan-friendly as can be with earth balance for the toast; soy rice and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap ask for added tofu (planks not crumble) and be astonished yet again.AND AND as a delicious cherry on top they have theme brunches fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is and make a point of going.  Get there early.
