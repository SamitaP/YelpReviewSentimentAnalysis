I have loved this place since I was a kid. It has not changed since then. This is not a nice place to dine in. It's a hole in the wall bar that makes Pittsburgh's best sandwiches. Huge stuffed hogies. I mean huge. The Battleship is the cornerstone size and it could satisfy 4-5 men no problem. My favs? Corned beef steak and the famous fried baloney but any selection is good. Go here get a hogie and take it to share.
