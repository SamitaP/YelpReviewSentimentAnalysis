I wasn't excited about Max's when I first walked in. There were no servers in evidence and I wandered through the entire restaurant looking for an employee to seat me before finally asking the bartender to help. After that though things definitely improved. I loved the slightly shabby old-world vibe. The old photos on the wall were interesting and the menu slash old newspaper was a pretty cute presentation. We got appetizers for dinner and my favorite by miles was the potato pocket with grilled onions on top. (Basically a pierogi.) So good. So so good. I actually wasn't as excited about the potato pancakes as I expected - maybe because I was expecting more of a latke style flavor profile? Not sure. We also got the stuffed pretzels - total heart attack on a plate - in a good way! I loved that everything we got came with dipping sauces. So fun. Overall a positive experience. I'd go back.
