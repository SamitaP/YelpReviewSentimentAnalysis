We came across Atria's looking for another restaurant but I was not disappointed! The Crab Bisque soup was creamy and delicious. I ordered chicken parmesan and it was fantastic as well. Ask for the cream vodka sauce! Portion was huge but it made a fine lunch the next day. Would definitely return to Atria's.
