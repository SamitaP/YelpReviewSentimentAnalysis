Expensive?  Yes.  Worth the price of admission?  Every penny.My wife and I dined at Alla Famiglia last night and we were both blown away.  It was our first time here so we went with our waiter's suggestions from start to finish.After snacking on the ridiculously delicious 'Holy Oil' we started with a couple apps -  Greens and Beans and the Meatball; both were incredible.  Braised endive house sausage and tender white beans seasoned to perfection and a meatball the size of your fist.Before our entrees were brought out we were each brought a salad and pasta course.  The fresh made pasta was served with the best vodka sauce I have ever had -   amazing.On to the entrees;  I got the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo and my wife got the Coteletta Del Monzu.  Spectacular.   Both the veal chop and the cutlet melted in our mouths.All in all after a couple apps two entrees a bottle of wine and a couple cocktails we got out for about $260 after tip.  That said I've eaten at some amazing restaurants in my time and I can say with confidence that last night's dinner is easily one of the top 5 meals I've had in my lifetime.  I can't wait to find an excuse to go back.Well done Alla Famiglia.Update:  Visits 2 and 3 to Alla Famiglia were just as spectacular as the first.  My wife and I have ordered something different each time we've visited and normally I'd say something like 'we haven't been disappointed'.  However that would be an egregious understatement.  Every visit to this wonderful restaurant has been nothing short of  astonishing.  The food is truly breathtaking and the service is top notch.In my humble opinion this is without question the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.Update 2:  As you can see by the number of check-ins I have here we find every excuse we can to continue to come here.  It is still the best restaurant in the 'Burgh.
