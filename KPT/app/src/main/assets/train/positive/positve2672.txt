Delicious Chinese food in a great though sometimes cheesy atmosphere.  Rice and vegetables from Sichuan House was one of my first solid foods as a child so I may be slightly biased but the food from Sichuan House is top notch.  Egg and spring rolls are both good and the number of vegetarian options is great.  The lo mein is always perfectly cooked; the buddhist medley is full of fresh veggies and huge pieces of fried tofu.  Lunch options are cheap and if you arrive with a big enough group you can sit in the private room in the back.  The service is always great and the food is some of the best I've ever had.  Get some take out or eat in but definitely try Sichuan House.
