Rock the Casbah! Rock the Casbah! A group of us went to the Casbah for a girls' (and one guy) lunch.  It has been ages since I've been to the Casbah and since I live clear across the country I was looking forward to going back.  All of us enjoyed our meals -- many ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Chopped Salad or the Wild Mushroom and Goat Cheese Omelet.  Both were nice portions. I was fixated on the Orecchiette Pasta grilled chicken dried cranberries Capriole goat cheese sage cream and it was a home run!  (I wasn't watching calories that day!)  Service was excellent . . . surprisingly so especially with a table of eleven a bunch of Sallies and one Harry if you know what I mean.
