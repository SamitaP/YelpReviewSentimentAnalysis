I have long wanted to eat Teppanyaki style food and been thinking of going to Benihana for a longest time. But after reading reviews on Yelp for the one in Sunnyvale CA I was quite apprehensive.I had also heard good things about Benihana in Pittsburgh from my brother in law and so decided to go there whenever I goto Pittsburgh.So finally we went there after New Years and had a blast. We had to wait at the bar even after making reservation but thats OK. At the table we were not rushed at all. The food was tasty and the chef was funny and interesting. Not to mention very entertaining and friendly bartender  - MARTY.Overall it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had.
