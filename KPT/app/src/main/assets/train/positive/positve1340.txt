Forget Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly this is quite possibly one of my favorite coops. They make some amazing deli items...so amazing that I went back twice during my visit to PA. I was only expecting to have a few options in the prepared food section but the vegan options were plentiful. Their mock tuna salad was impressive made with tvp vegenaise and spices. The potato salad was creamy and exceptionally delicious. And the vegan pasta salad was also impressive. Generally most grocers fail in this department but East End excels by leaps and bounds. I can't believe how tasty their store-made food was. The prices were also very reasonable if not low. If I lived in PA I'd join their coop and would go there frequently.
