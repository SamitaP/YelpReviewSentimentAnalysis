This place is crazy! It's an Indian restaurant located within a Days Inn. I love it because it's so quirky. Go for the buffet. Don't bother with the menu. The buffet is just as unique as the location of the restaurant. They usually have several vegetarian options and some meat options also. What makes this buffet so different is the fact that it has malai kofta pickled toppings and self serve mango lassi. I have never seen any of the above mentioned items on a buffet.The taste is not the best and sometimes the food comes off as warmed over but it is good and so much fun to stop in and stuff your belly with as much or as little as you like all while sitting in such an unusual location.
