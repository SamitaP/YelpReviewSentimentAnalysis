I have sampled pretty much every Indian eatery in the Pittsburgh area and hands down this is as close to an authentic Indian meal that I have found. The price is reasonable and the food is consistently tasty. The buffet typically has a wide variety of items to choose from and includes mango lasse and hot chai tea. It's not a typical setting for such a culinary find but don't let that keep you from trying their fantastic cuisine.
