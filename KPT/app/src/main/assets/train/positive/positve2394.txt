I wanted to scout out Regent Square as I'm fairly new to the area and it was recomended by someone who lives there and really talked it up.  So I parked and started walking looking for a lunch spot.  I spied D's Sixpax & Dogz I think because of it's open air concept.  the tables weren't outside but inside next to the window and I noticed there was no glass on said window.  Yay!  Let's head inside to nosh and get a nice breeze.It has a nice atmosphere -- a nice bar pub and enough people dining to get the feeling it's a happening place.  I have the feeling dogs are the popular item based on the name of the place but I'm really not a hotdog fan except at sporting events so I opted for the Black 'n Blue Burger smothered with bleu cheese and cajun seasoning.  It comes with homestyle chips and I added an order of coleslaw. Wonderful burger -- big moist and tasty!  Definitely hit the spot (multiple spots actually).  Very satisfying lunch.Side bonus for me -- happened to hear music from a local band from Denver (former homestead) while dining.  Made me homesick.
