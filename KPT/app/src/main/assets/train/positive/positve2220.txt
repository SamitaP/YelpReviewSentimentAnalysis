The hotel has a little listing for Maharaja which includes some pretty specific and weird hours none of which include Mondays. I called on a Monday to confirm and got a dude saying they close 9ish. I showed up and they have a menu that states pretty simply 11am - 10pm 7 days a week.. Buffet closes at 9:30.They didn't speak about point to or even half heartedly gesture to the menu. I was immediately pointed to the buffet and told have whatever you want or something similar. There were 6 veg options  4 meats (biryanis and curries) nan poori and bhajis kheer and pleasantly hot gulab jamun average (free unlimited) lassi some good chai  and decent chutneys and lemon pickles.Meals ends with mukhwa but the candy and plain fennel seeds are kept in seperate bowls. The emphasis on customer self-reliance here could be construed as bad or lazy service but I appreciate the lax environment.
