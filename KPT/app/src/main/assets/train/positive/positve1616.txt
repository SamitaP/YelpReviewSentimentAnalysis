So apparently I have this habit at least last week of visiting a bar/restaurant during its most dead time. In this case it was somewhat understandable for Clark Bar & Grill because it was a very uneventful sports week. Regardless I wanted to check out this place housed in the old manufacturing warehouse of the historic Clark Bar Candy Co. (RIP) just north of PNC Park.I wasn't overly impressed with either the menu or beer selections. In fact there were only five beers on tap and one had just kicked. I ordered the special a Reuben sandwich with tater tots which were both decent. I washed it down with a Penn Pilsner (local brew) and then left to go check out another place on the North Side.This may be a good spot to hit up before/after a Pirates or Steelers game because of its proximity to both stadiums but I'm not sure I'd venture back otherwise.
