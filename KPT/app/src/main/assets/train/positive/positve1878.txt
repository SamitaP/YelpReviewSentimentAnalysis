Came back for the holidays and stopped by Beto's.  The pizza hasn't changed a bit and it remains in my top three in the town.  However can someone please teach the kids working there how to keep up an establishment?  Not once did I see someone clean tables or remove the number tags from the table.  We had to clean our own table.  The floor was littered with straw wrappers and napkins especially under our table.  The bathroom was in shambles and my friend mentioned that the ladies room was out of tp.  Therefore--three stars with the pizza saving the review from total damnation.
