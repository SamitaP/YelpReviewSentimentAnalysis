Definitely a must-try diner in Pittsburgh and a great place to take out-of-town guests for a unique breakfast.  My plate of choice has got to be the Apple Cinnamon Pancakes.  If you are going for the first time make sure somebody in your group orders pancakes.  They are a must try.  The raspberry french toast is delicious and very filling too.  The omelets are good as well.
