Real authentic Italian food. The must try dishes are 1) Meatball appetizer amazing 2) smoked provolone with arugula 3) Mussels in diavolo sauce. The Holy oil served with warm bread is truly holy. Little spicy but oh so flavorful. Excellent service and they will modify any recipe to your liking. If you like Italian food then this is a must!!
