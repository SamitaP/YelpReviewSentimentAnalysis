I was a little skeptical when I heard that this was one of those TV places. I've been to Georgetown Cupcakes and Carlo's Bakery and they both failed to live up to the hype created by their TV fame. The Dor-Stop remains unaffected by stardom however and that is a very good thing. We showed up on a Tuesday morning at around 9:30 and there were plenty of open tables. As noted by almost everyone else here the service was top notch the prices were reasonable and the food fantastic. I had the banana chocolate chip pancakes and they were out of this world! I'll be back!
