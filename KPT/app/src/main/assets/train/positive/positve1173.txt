Remember the days of bands in the back at night and interesting kids hanging out at the bar all day? Well the bands were the first to go followed quickly by the comfy sofas. The kids didn't take long to leave and now years later faced with a frankly less-than-appetizing Saturday menu I find that the ability to substitute something else for the increasing amounts of potato filler is gone too.Quiet Storm used to be a straight five star. My last experience was honestly two-star but nostalgia and history don't allow me to give it less than a three.I'm sure all the changes over the years have been in the name of efficiency but they've come at expense to the clientele. Here's hoping Quiet Storm rediscovers the mojo (and the menu) that once made them great.
