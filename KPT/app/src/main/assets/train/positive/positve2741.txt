If ever there was a fast food place that I could say that I love it would be Boston Market.  You go in you order at the counter you pay you get your food and then take it to your seat just like every other fast food joint.  But here you have fresh roasted chicken -- MMM.  Today was an off day though and they had sold out of the chicken.  The associates said they had an untimely barrage of customers and that it would be ten more minutes before the next batch of chicken was ready  not wanting to wait I opted to try one of their newer sandwiches and ordered:Brisket and Swiss dip (au jus)Mac n cheeseMashed Potatoes and brown gravyI love Boston Market's Mac n' cheese.  The noodles are spiral and always al dente -- today was no different. The mashed potatoes and gravy -- while obviously not homemade -- are always good with a little pepper.  I must say though that my chicken stand-in was also very good.  Not up to the fresh chicken standards; but good none-the-less.  The meat was moist and the au jus was flavorful.  I wish the bread was not as dry but I had au jus so there was balance.When needing food on the run I will always go to Boston Market if given the choice.
