Lovely relaxing atmosphere. The cauliflower soup with tarragon emulsion was fabulous as was the tomato basil soup. The waiter was attentive and happily allowed for a substitution on my salad so I could try one of the raw milk cheeses from their cheese sampler. The grilled chicken breast on my salad was a bit more dry and hard than I like but I am not a big fan of barbecuing chicken and it certainly seemed to have been charred that way. If the chicken had been moist this place would get all five stars from me!
