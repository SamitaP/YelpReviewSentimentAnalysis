I've been going to Miller's since I was just a little tyke.  Unfortunately over the years this joint has gone downhill.  I think I really began to notice it when they put a big tv in the dining area.  Now you can imagine that you're home in front of your own tv while you dine.  Holy Hell.  It's a mess.  The food isn't nearly as good as it once was.  The pierogi special is good if it's on the menu - they are Pierogi Plus pierogies.  The bread is Bread Work's bread so that's good.  My favorite thing on the menu used to be the devonshire but only the brave try it these days.  In the grand scheme of life this place is a fine local blue collar restaurant but compared to the days of old the food is just blah.ps. The ladies who wait here are always and have always been the nicest of folk.
