As if this place needs another glowing review!When I first moved to Pittsburgh a local clued me in to the wonders of D's. She leaned forward and whispered ....yeah 'suchandsuchbar' is alright but if you want the BEST beer selection in Pittsburgh with the friendliest staff go to D's Six Pax and Dogz. She proceeded to give me directions. Mind you this was a total stranger. But I liked the mystique so obviously I jumped in my car and found D's (her directions were perfect.) Walking into the beer cave is an almost religious experience. What's this to my immediate left? Seasonal brews? Yes I'll definitely have some of those. Trippel Belgians? Count me in. Beers brewed by monks? Of course. All the Dogfish Head and Rogue a girl could ever want? Double check. Giant bottles of Chimay? I must be dreaming. And if you thought things couldn't get any better you're clearly not following along close enough-you get $1.00 off every bottle you take to go. Bobby and I brought a friend here last night because he said he had never been. We stocked up on pumpkin beers and they even had Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale which I can never seem to find anywhere. Our friend was in awe. The only downside I can possibly think of when it comes to D's is the magical time powers that seem to exist in the beer cave. I kid you not I've sometimes found myself in the beer cave for over 45 minutes agonizing over crafting the perfect six pack. Of course this isn't D's fault. I'm naturally indecisive. I love this place so good.
