I feel like I'm being generous with my star allocation.  But I also feel that I need to be a bit forgiving since I've been sick the past few days and my tastebuds are a bit off.  That being said the friends I was with also didn't seem overly impressed by the food so I think I'm being generous and the rating should be more like 2.5.I ordered the spinach ravioli and they were just ok.  There was way too much sauce and I guess I anticipated it to taste a bit more basily or something - it did say basil cream sauce but what I got just seemed like a whole lotta tomato vodka sauce.  The spinach and ricotta didn't have much flavor but perhaps that was due to my diminished lack of taste these few days with being sick.  All I could taste was the tomato sauce and that to me does not make a great or particularly good meal.  Oh and to top it off the $4/person corkage fee is outrageous.
