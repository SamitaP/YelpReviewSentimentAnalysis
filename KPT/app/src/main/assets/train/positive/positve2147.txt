Best breakfast in Pittsburgh. Hands down no competition. My favorite meal is their breakfast sandwich with bacon. It's on Italian toast with lettuce tomato and mayo. In the fall I love the pumpkin pancakes! And if you're in the mood for something sweet you have to check out the raspberry stuffed French toast - just unreal. Not to mention that the servers are incredibly friendly. This place is family owned and has such a great vibe.
