I hate to admit this but I have been here three times and always order the same thing. I usually like to order new things to see if the quality is consistent but I love the turkey burger with olives and feta SOOO much I can't bring myself to do it. (Next time I promise I'll branch out and will write and update then...) I have tried various starters and sides as well and have always been impressed.The waitstaff is not notably friendly but is friendly enough. They ask many questions to make sure your order is the way you want it (for example someone else in my party ordered the fish sandwich and was asked: Broiled/grilled? Tarter/cocktail? Lettuce/onion/tomato? Side dish?). It is nice though because they will bring it out EXACTLY the way you ask for it.Overall it's a great spot!
