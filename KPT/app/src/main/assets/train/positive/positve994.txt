Um.  A little bummed.  I had high expectations but left feeling just...meh.The restaurant is really cool looking but I was a little confused by the bar set up.  We sat at the bar because they didn't have any tables open.  I usually don't mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor and about 2 feet from each other.  If you have three people with you forget about mingling!  Also the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself just asked what we wanted and kept saying okay okay okay.  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.I tried the prix fixed brunch for $24 which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary Sangria or Mimosa) appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:) Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta which was delish: light fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.  I loved it!The Eggs Beni with smoked salmon.  It was just okay.  I kept trying to think pf what was missing and I believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste.  I expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy this was thin and blah.  I definitely want to go back and try the dinner see if maybe I'll have a little better luck.  So kick it up a notch Casbah you've been around for a while but I still expect good food!
