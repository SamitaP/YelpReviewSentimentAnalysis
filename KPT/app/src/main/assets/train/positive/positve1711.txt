Peanutz is a perfectly good neighborhood bar on East Ohio Street.  Their beer selection is adequate (basically all the American macro lagers plus a few of the more widely-known craft beers like Sierra Nevada) and their bar is stocked with the full gamut of booze (except ouzo).  Trish the bartender is a fantastic bartender with a hilariously sharp tongue.I haven't tried very many of the menu items except for the chicken wings which are a house specialty.  Everyone recommends the Four-Dip sauce which is pretty good.  The Cajun rub is good too.Decor-wise Peanutz is focused largely on Pittsburgh sports -- there are two large display cases with all sorts of sports memorabilia.  There's a handsome wooden bar in the front room and a dining room off to the side.
