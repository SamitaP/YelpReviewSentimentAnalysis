To put it frankly Campitis is the place to get pizza and hoagies.  I've been going here since I was a kid and will always go here... as long as I can.  The atmosphere and the pizza are as good as it gets.  Campitis defines hometown pizza and to be honest it's some of the best pizza I've ever had (including during my international travels).  It's thin light and the sauce is perfect.  My recommendation is to combine it with a half Italian hoagie and you have one heck of a meal!  Salads are simple but also great.  And for the price you absolutely cannot beat it.  If you haven't been here yet you're missing out.
