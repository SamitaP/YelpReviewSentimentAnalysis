It looks like a diner it is priced like a decent restaurant and it tastes great.The idea here is simple you are paying for quality of the ingredients not the table cloths or snooty waiters.Our meal started with the fried motzerrla  7.95. It came as 5 huge hunks of cheese with a great marana sauce. This was made in house not frozen sticks from a box they come as large triangles. Meals include a some great rosemary bread olive oil and soup or salad.For my main I had the spinach ravioli in a pink sauce $15. This was a generous portion of homemade ravioli with enough spinach to taste and rich ricotta cheese. The sauce was luxurious and packed with savory goodness.Service was fun and family like the meal ended with a complimentary piece of homemade fudge.Maybe this is not good for a 1st date but its good for a great meal or  a casual 4th date for when the food matters more than the looks.
