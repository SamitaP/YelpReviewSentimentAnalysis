I rarely give a business a superior rating but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery.   The food was delicious  the beer every recipe sampled  was amazing and the service was wonderful.  The staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. Please support this business.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
