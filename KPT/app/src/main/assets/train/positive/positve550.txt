First off I have to note their Maine Lobster Bisque is amazing. Definately don't miss out on it. That being said we had lunch there and the lunch portions are a good value. I had the Cedar Plank salmon. The fish was fantastic except that the vegetables were a little bland. The atmosphere at the restaurant is quite relaxed and I don't think I've ever seen it get more than mildly busy in there so it is a nice place to go to have a quiet meal with someone special.
