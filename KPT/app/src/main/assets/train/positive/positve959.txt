Part of the same restaurant group as Eleven which I have eaten at and reviewed here Casbah is a vibrant restaurant in Pittsburgh's Shadyside district.While the menu changes daily there are several mainstays available on most evenings.  One of them the pork chop is one of the finest I have ever had.  Double cut juicy and flavorful it is an absolute winner.  Braised kale and butternut squash risotto accompany this perfect dish.I managed to sample two other dishes (courtesy of my willing dinner mates) that are also noteworthy.  The short rib ravioli is an excellent combination of tender richly flavored beef rib and toothy pasta.  The ricotta cavatelli combines fresh simple ingredients into a well structured dish.Service was a little hit or miss the evening I was there.  Part of that may be because we were a large group and the restaurant was rather busy.  However for an establishment of this caliber I do expect more.  Nevertheless I plan on trying Casbah again on my next trip to Pittsburgh.
