After hearing about AF and reading the reviews I was expecting an amazing experience. We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. Homey old school Italian feel. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing better than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. We were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down. For the price I have had better meals and better service at other restaurants around the city.
