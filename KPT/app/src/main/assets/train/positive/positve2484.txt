Pretty danggum awesome hotdogs beer and anything you could possibly want to order in a bar that would immediately spike your cholesterol 50 points.  Serious nachos?  Check.  Fries drenched in meats and cheese?  Check check.  It's some Blue-Collar goodness with a little Hipster aftertaste.    The hotdogs are worth the hype (yay Angry Tiki dog with pinapple and bacon!) and the beer cave is a happy place with one of the best selections in the city.
