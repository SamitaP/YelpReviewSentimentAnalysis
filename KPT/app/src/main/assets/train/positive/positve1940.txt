Best pizza in the land (Steeler's Nation that is) enough said.  Eat it there for the crisp crust if you like crust a little more forgiving get it to go and let it soak up the juices from the San Marzano tomatoes.  Another bene to having the pizza on premise the cold sprinkled cheese.  To die for.Coming at peak times is risky as the dining room is small and seating is first come first served.  I love this place and have been eating here for 25 years since I was a little guy.  I would say Fiori's is a close second but when I am in town and have limited time...Beto's it is!
