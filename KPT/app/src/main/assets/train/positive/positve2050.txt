Just like the TV show claims this place is no joke (diners drive-ins and dives).So go with one friend you'll get sat faster.  Then order your pancake choice (chocolate chip just makes sense) and the scrambled up thing that I forget the name of.  Just them them you want the thing you're supposed to get that's not pancakes they'll know.  And share it all.Fantastic.  And it's so close.  I should brunch there weekly.
