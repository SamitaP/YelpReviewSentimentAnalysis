Great place!! Tried a different bar in town and was highly disappointed by it so we tried this place and we love it!! The only problem is they close too early on Sunday lol. We didn't have the food to eat but everything they have brought out for other customers looks and smells great! But definitely good drinks great atmosphere and super friendly staff!! Oh! And they have carry out beer!!
