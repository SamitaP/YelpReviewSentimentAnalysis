I love coming to PNC Park in the Summer. If i get here early enough i stop by atria's and have a scotch Johnny Walker rocks no water what did that scotch ever do to you? When i was eating meat I'd get the lobster bisque or a huge plate of pot roast nachos. The meat that covered those nachos were perfectly cooked with a nice char outside moist and succulent inside. Lots of cheese and other nacho fixens. Good Stuff!The burgers here are just as glorious nice crisp outside moist and tender inside good bun great bacon if i ordered it. Atria's is a great restaurant in PNC Park but when i go to PNC Park I want ballpark food. So I head to Atria's when the Bucs are out of town.
