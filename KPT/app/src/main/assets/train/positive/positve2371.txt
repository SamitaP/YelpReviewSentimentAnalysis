Great hot dogs.  Great beers on tap.  I always fill up on way too much beer and way too much food when I'm here because it's all so good.  I would recommend anything on the menu.And who wouldn't love the Beer Cave?  They have an amazing selection of beers to go.  It can sometimes be overwhelming.  But I like having so many choices.  The wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  Check it out!
