I mean it's Applebee's but as far as chain places go it's the best in my opinion. The happy hour specials are awesome ($3.50 20oz liquor drinks can't beat that) and half off apps. Four bucks for a huge thing of spinach and artichoke dip is great.The blue agave frozen margarita is delicious as is their long island.The two for 20 deal is great I had the quesadilla burger which was quite nice. Get the flavors of Mexican food in a burger and with tortilla for bun you don't have all the extra bread to bog you down.Our server was great the last time we went we went at 11:30 on a Friday (they're open until 1am) and he didn't try and shuffle us out or anything was attentive and quite nice. Will absolutely be back especially for happy hour and late nights.
