Went there for lunch today. Needing some food other than hospital food. Short walk to it from Allegheny General. Thought about ordering lunch special  but she said if we wanted more than two slices get the pizza on sale. 10 slice pizza for $8.25 and one topping. Great pizza. Crust was excellent tiny bit of garlic and lightly sweet. Ham was tasty Canadian bacon. Nice size to for price.  Pop sold by can at .85cents.Lady at counter said she made crust and bread from scratch  we could tell.I would have given it a 4 star but bathroom cleanliness held them back. I didn't add the street people into my review. The street is being revitalized so a lot of businesses are open and some closed. If it was farther from the liquor store the street people would not have been so plentiful.
