I took my cousin from California here for lunch. We were both eating lite since a) I was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother's house and she was slaving over lasagna all day so if anyone knows anything about Italian mother's you better arrive hungry. Back to mitchell's I had the iceberg wedge with bacon egg tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn't overly packed with rice as a matter of fact there wasn't much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab scallops and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn't a lot of heat just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than cheesy it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I've tasted in the past. I highly recommend it. It was a wonderful lunch and I'm sure she had carrot cake to take on the plane ride back to Riverside.
