My first visit to the chain in years. Not exactly fine dining but this was open until midnight on weekdays.I had roast beef sliders and a bowl of French onion soup. The sandwich buns were mushy otherwise everything was fairly good.Service was very good. Meal clocked in around $15 with tip which I think is 3 or 4 too high. Much more extensive menu than Denny's along with a bar if you happen to need a late night fill up.
