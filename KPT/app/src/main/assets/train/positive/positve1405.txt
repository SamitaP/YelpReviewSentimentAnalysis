The food is unforgettable but unfortunately so is the bill.  Sicilian themed with fresh ingredients in an intimate setting all prepared in an open kitchen.Ask before you order a special or you might be stunned when you are handed the check. But if you love food and money is no object this is your place. A great place for Valentine's day or a special anniversary splurge with the emphasis on the word 'splurge'.
