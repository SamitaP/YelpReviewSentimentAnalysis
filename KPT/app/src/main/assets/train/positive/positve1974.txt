Yum. I love when places surprise you! Brunch is my passion so I am always on the hunt for new spots. I love the Pamela's scene but sometimes you need that bloody mary to hold you off until you can dig into your home fries. BLOODY MARY BAR O HEY! Pros: breakfast and booze huge portions ( I got a side of oatmeal and it was double a meal portion) CHEAP!!!! Early hours Cons: Parking is a bitch slower (a huge party sat before us though) Def will be back for some day drinking
