Just plain awesome! We read some reviews before trying and people basically love the ribs. Some complained about the guy behind the counter being surly and that it is a hole in the wall. Well we expected a Soup Nazi experience and the main problem was that their television echoes through the place while the soft-spoken guy positioned about 30 feet away at the oven asks what you want with soft-spoken voice. I felt badly saying What? so many times but finally got the order straight. He was very patient with us.After tasting the magnificent ribs we told him that these were the best ribs we'd ever tasted (also over the dratted television noise). The guy was positively beaming and we had a nice conversation with him. He said the recipe has been in the family for 140 years so far. He also said that the style was Louisiana BBQ. I had mild and my brother-in-law had hot. We were both extremely satisfied. There was plenty of meat on the ribs and they were done to perfection. They did not have cole slaw but we did try potato salad--very good too!The ambiance is nothing to write home about but it seemed good enough. But the ribs are so good that I very much look forward to actually LONG to go back again. I crave the ribs and it's only been 4 days since I was there for the first time.
