The sundae bar is a big hit with my kids particularly the blue whipped cream (I shudder to think what's actually in that). The food's pretty much the same stuff you can get at Friday's Applebee's etc. I like their salad with the almonds and blue cheese-- they sometimes really dowse it in dressing but it's good.
