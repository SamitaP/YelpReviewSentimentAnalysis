I typically enjoy my visits to the Dor-Stop.  The banana and chocolate-chip pancakes are probably the best pancakes that I've ever tried.  I appreciate that they have some vegetarian breakfast options.  The line at this place is always crazy but if it's a nice day it's no big deal.  We sometimes wander over to the small bookstore.  My husband loves the Guy's Version of Vicki's Jumbot ham.   i usually get an omelet and they're ok.  Nothing out of this world.  I'm not a big fan of the potatoes of any version at Dor-Stop and I think to me that's the biggest disappointment.  Other than that the pancakes alone are worth a trip!
