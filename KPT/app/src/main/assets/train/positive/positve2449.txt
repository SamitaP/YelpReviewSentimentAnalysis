The beer cave is amazing and you get $1 off each bottle if you take out... Which means that some of them end up being cheaper than if you bought a case! WOW. The food is really good. I have been here several times and each time I told the server to bring me something vegetarian. I have never been disappointed!! From hotdogs to seitan to nachos everything here tastes great and there are tons of options. The last time I was there we were having fun upstairs playing darts and racking up a tab. The bartender was nice enough to actually stop us and point out that it had started to snow and we should probably leave before the roads got bad... I thought that was super sweet and nice of him!!
