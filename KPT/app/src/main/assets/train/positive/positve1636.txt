I was fortunate enough to enjoy a Saturday night Oktoberfest celebration here this past weekend. A friend of mine is a member of this private German heritage club and got tickets for me and our lady friends for this celebration.We brought our own steins (which cost varying prices to fill throughout the night depending on whom we asked) but were always full of beer from excellent breweries like Spaten and Hofbrauhaus. We enjoyed a phenomenal buffet with two delicious wursts pork cutlets potato pancakes sauerkraut and a whole mess of tasty German sides dishes. And we spent the next three or four hours in a handsome ballroom with folks as much as three times our age drinking beer and enjoying awesomely German music from Fred Zurich and His Sound Machine.What a great time this place was! I've never had so much fun being 1/4 German in all my life. If you have a chance to visit take it!
