It's kinda strange when you enter because you literally hit the hotel's registration counter and then you wonder where the restaurant is because it looks like the hotel couldn't fit a restaurant.  It's to the left of the counter.  Anyhow I have mixed feelings.  One it's a huge buffet.  Two it's cheap (8.99 for dinner maybe 7.99? for lunch) and includes all you can drink soda chai etc.  Three mango lassi is part of the buffet.  Four the food on the buffet can be very strange.  So pricewise when you include free drinks/mango lassi it's damn worth it as long as you can find two or three other items you like.  On the other hand you may not like anything at all on the buffet.  Their nan is average in texture but has garlic and herbs so it's now foccacia nan and tastes delicious.  Papadum is done well.  Lamb kabobs are good but I wish they had lamb curry.  Their selection of meat is small relative to the size of the buffet.On the other hand they have plenty of vegetarian items but I prefer to avoid cream butter and cheese that I didn't eat much of them.  I did try the spinach and they have the most wonderful version of spinach: it's cheesy spinach (but doesn't look like there's melted cheese in it).  Awesome.  But then again their chickpeas were in a sauce that tasted like a combination of spaghetti sauce and ketchup-- yuck!I suppose this place is geared to fat vegetarians who can have dairy.  Oh and the atmosphere is pretty lonesome.  It was probably once the grand dining hall of the hotel and now kinda ghostly.  I think it's worth an initial visit and worth it for budget eaters.
