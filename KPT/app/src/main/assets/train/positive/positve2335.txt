D's does the chicago style hot dog very well they even use sport peppers which I can never find in the grocery store. The bun is steamed and features the quintessential poppy seed exterior.D's beer selection is also great but I'm not much of a beer drinker so it's not something I've ever focused on. The general consensus I've heard is that there is better selection elsewhere and the prices are a little high but you can't beat both their hot dogs and their beer selection at the same time making them a great bar.Their fries are so crispy that I suspect they're double fried. They're tasty and the toppings available can turn them into a bastard concoction of delicious artery clogging glory. There's been nothing on D's menu that I've been disappointed with.The service can be a little hit or miss due mostly to the sheer amount of business they do on a Friday or Saturday night.
