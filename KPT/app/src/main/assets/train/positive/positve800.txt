Finally a great neighborhood coffee shop that just so happens to brew fantastic coffee. The espresso is incredible which makes for an excellent cappuccino and the food is pretty good too. Croissants muffins and other baked goods top the breakfast list while made-to-order paninis and delicious homemade soups round out the lunch menu.The crowd at Enrico's is varied which I really enjoy. My 65-year-old neighbor and his crew of retired friends pull up a chair every day at 3:00 pm next to business folks college students techies and other folks who are looking for a good brew.No frills no extras; just nice people in a quaint coffee shop brewing up warm goodness.
