I have been going to Pino's for several years with my family so I feel well qualified to give a balanced review rather than basing it on a single experience good or bad. Every restaurant can have a bad day. And even the worst places can please some customers every now and then. What you get at Pino's is great service and excellent food. If your idea of Italian is the Olive Garden you are in for an education and a treat. This is the real deal. We have a family of picky eaters including a full blown celiac and we all love it.Yes over the years I have twice seen owner/chef Joe unhappy with unhappy customers. In one case the customer was arrogant and offensive. On the other occasion Joe should have swallowed his pride if only to avoid the coordinated revenge reviews that followed.
