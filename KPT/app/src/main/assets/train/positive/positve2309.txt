What a cool place.  The beercave was very unique.  If I hadn't just had my wisdom teeth out I would have totally sampled some of the fine brews they had stocked away.  What I did enjoy was the friend zucchini.  It was hot from the fryer when it got to our table and it absolutely hit the spot.  I'd never had it before and zucchini is one of my favorite vegetables.  My friend said that the service can be slow but we didn't have any problems.
