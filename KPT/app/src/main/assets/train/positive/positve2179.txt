Camp's has a cult following.   As soon as you walk in you can smell the melting mozzarella.  Love that smell.  W grew up on Camp's and is almost in the cult so we go to Camp's from time to time.  It has been a real long time since our last visit so it was fun to stop back in.  The crust is a medium thickness not to thin and not to thick and somewhat crunchy.  One friend calls it almost like a biscuit I really don't get that but it is a little chewy and just a little brown around the edge.  One thing that I notice is they do not overload the pizza with sauce and toppings like some places.  Enjoyed our pizza and will be back.  Have had the hoagie in the past and if I remember correctly it is very good.
