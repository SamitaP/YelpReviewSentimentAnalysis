D's is a great place!  Its unique as far as quasi-bars are concerned insofar as I go with a friend and have some dogs/burgers/pizza/wings and a few beers and have a great time; yet feel equally as comfortable taking the family for a night out.  The food is good the staff is friendly the prices are great and the beer selection is fantastic.  Its a great place for a family meal on a budget!
