Got lunch from here today. What I sampled: Maine Lobster Bisque (delicious and the whole reason for getting lunch from here)Cheeseburger (decent version I only ate about half but I expect the other half won't last long)Overall I enjoy going here though it is a bit overpriced but sometimes I am just in the mood for that lobster bisque!
