I ordered the Roast Pork loin with Apple raisin dressing sauerkraut and German potatoes. Oh yeah... Right Choice! Took a little longer than usual as there was a Large Party of 16 that ordered Just prior to us. Happy to say the waitress took Great care of us plenty of rolls drink refills etc. as we waited. Apple Strudel for the Final Act. So Good I forgot to take a picture. lol
