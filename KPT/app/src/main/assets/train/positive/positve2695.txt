After a long enduring 12 plus hour trip to Pittsburgh my shuttle driver told me about the delivery service at Vincent's and suggested their food was worth checking out. Overwhelmed with work at that time of the night and unfamiliarity with the area prompted a quick call for their Ad's Rockin' Pasta ($17). I was initially told the delivery would arrive in 45 minutes to an hour but the food came knocking on my hotel room sooner than expected. The complimentary mini garlic buns were cooled by that time. It was over-buttered but yummy nonetheless. It was a delight to see the whopping serving of pasta after not having anything to eat all day. Thankfully it was kept warm by the plastic container and comforting with every bite. The generous servings of angel hair was filled to the brim with juicy chicken slices very few shrimps mushrooms roasted and hot peppers drenched in a mild marinara sauce. The flood of sweet and semi-savory marinara was not the ideal and the peppers also did not make an impression. The quality of the pasta was overcooked and oversoaked but the pieces of chunky chicken were tender and delicious. The side salad did not look very fresh and was not newsworthy.I didn't get a chance to visit the venue to get a better impression of the establishment but as a delivery service I thought it was fast while portions were very generous. Value wise kudos to them for having a $5 children's menu for those at the ages 2-10. For my dish however I still consider it overpriced for what was supposed to be their fanciest pasta dish. 2.5 stars for the experience.
