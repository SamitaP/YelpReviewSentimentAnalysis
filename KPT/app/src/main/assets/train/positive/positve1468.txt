Very good Italian. The portions are very large so do not be tempted by the bread early. My fianc√© and I shared two appetizers and an entree. The entree also gives a huge bowl of salad and penne alla vodka. This was so much food we couldn't even look at the dessert menu. I would absolutely recommend this place but would suggest pacing yourself.
