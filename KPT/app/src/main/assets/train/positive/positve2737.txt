Our server (Miss) Debbie deserves 10 stars alone. She was such a sweetie the entire time. After offering us a wine sample and checking our IDs we were on a first-name basis the entire evening. (of course we added Miss before her name each time) Her words: it makes our guests more comfortable as if they were at homeWe had a 5 month old gift card that was collecting dust & decided to head here for dinner. There was no wait on a Thursday evening and many other tables were also available. We took advantage of the current special: 3 course meal for $10. You received unlimited breadsticks (of course) & also got to choose between unlimited salad or soup. We both chose the salad. For the entree there were different pastas to choose from & you also had the opportunity to choose the sauce.  I ordered paccheri with Alfredo sauce & added shrimp. Bobby had the whole wheat linguine with Alfredo as well & added chicken. My dish came out without shrimp. I was in the process of trying to get Debbie's attention when the manager came over to ask how our meal was going. I didn't want to throw her under the bus so we agreed that it was fine. He brought up did you by chance order shrimp & i said yes. He took my plate & brought out a fresh one in no time. For dessert (there were 3 options to choose from for the special) I ordered the chocolate mousse cake & Bobby ordered tiramisu. He's way overly picky about that dish and wasn't a fan. My mousse cake was delish though. It may be frowned upon for giving a chain Italian restaurant a 4 star review but ah the service alone was divine. Debbie informed us during a small talk that she had worked at OG for 22 years... pretty much my entire life existence. She made sure before putting in our order that we had no other obligations afterward (I'm not sure what would have been done differently if we did have somewhere to be but it was a kind gesture) I was half tempted to get her number and continue our small talk over a cup of tea :)
