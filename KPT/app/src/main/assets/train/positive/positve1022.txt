Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi tuna tartare arugala salad bread pudding and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!
