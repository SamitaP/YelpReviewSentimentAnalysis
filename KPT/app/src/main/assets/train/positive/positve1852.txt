Green Garden is not by any means the pinnacle of Chinese food. It is however a suitable meal for reasonable prices.The staff is very friendly and casual. After so many years of eating there they know my family and it is nice to remembered after having spent so much money there.Our regular dishes of fried dumplings chicken and broccoli etc. are all well done standards of Chinese takeout. It may not be spectacular but it gets the job done.When push comes to shove Green Garden is an acceptable restaurant with great service. I will always be a regular (save something horrendous happens with one of our meals but is hasn't happened yet).
