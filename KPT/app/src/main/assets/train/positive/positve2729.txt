Yep it's a chain. Yep it's the but of a lot of jokes by the In the know set.  Yep it is kind of inexplicable how long the wait can be on weekends. Yep I know it's more politically correct to eat at a  locally-owned family restaurant.   But you know what?  I've never once had a bad meal there.  I've never once had less than top-shelf service there.  I find Olive Garden restaurants have consistently higher quality not only compared to the other franchise stores in it's price range but also notably better than some family owned Italian restaurants I could name.
