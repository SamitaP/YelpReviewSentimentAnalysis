An excellent choice for fresh well prepared seafood located in the Waterfront area in Homestead.   I frequent this area for business travel and you can't do much better without heading downtown.The seafood is excellent with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials a raw bar and a list of chef's specialties.  The house salad is sweet and delicious and the 'shanghai' seafood preparation is delicious healthy and unique.  Try it with the scallops or a white-fleshed fish.There is a nice selection of regional beers on tap a decent selections of wines and creative drinks (think elderflower and pear martinis).  The deserts are adequate though not a highlight.  If you're on the Waterfront you won't do better than this.  Enjoy!
