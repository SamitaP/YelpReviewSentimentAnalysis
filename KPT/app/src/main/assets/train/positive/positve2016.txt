Ok.  This used to be our favorite spot in the area but the past two times we have been here were not the best.   Today's meal was cold burnt and  rubbery.  We had fish and chips.  Burnt mushy fish and cold over cooked chips.  Loaded potato soup was so thick you could use it for paste.  The app we had was the best part of the meal.   The last time we wets here my fianc√© got food poisoning from a burger special.   I'm beginning to think we need to go elsewhere from now on.
