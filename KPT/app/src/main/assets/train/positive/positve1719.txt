The owners are great and have been serving me hot dogs since I was in middle school.  They do hot dogs right. At Steve's New York Hotdog what you ask for is what you get. I would be devastated if they ever closed down shop but from the looks of Steve's is doing just fine.During the lunch rush the line could easily stretch out the door.Regularly I get the double dog platter. Which is two hotdogs an order of fries and a drink.  Any topping you want is already included in the price of the hot dogs.  They have onions chili. cheese pickles and the list continues.  The hamburgers here are thin and of the frozen variety and lack any seasoning on the meat. The fries are always fried to order.  Steve's also serves breakfast. I think I'll go have lunch there today.The location of this hotdog ship is situated on an area of Federal that is a tad questionable. But new developments on the street are making the area more inhabitable.  The interior of the restaurant is shappy and dated but there are stools where you can eat at the counter but less than 15 so if you eat here it's more of a to go place.
