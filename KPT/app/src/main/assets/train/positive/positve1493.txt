While this is a take out only place it definitely reminds me of home. Growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania DiCarlos was one of the joints we always frequented. The pizza is just as good as it was growing up. I was able to introduce my fiance to DiCarlos. He really enjoyed it and said it was delicious except it was not hot.  The only grow I have and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is pizza temp.
