Another one of Pittsburgh's finest restaurants.  The best things about Casbah are it's very cool atmosphere good service (a very friendly hostess and knowledgeable server).I had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection) and several appetizers soups and salad.  Everything was delicious especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  Most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers and I really liked they even gave them credit on the menu the first time I have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? After all they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).The atmosphere is really cool I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  The only negative things I can say about Casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (I expected more of a Middle Eastern menu and vibe).
