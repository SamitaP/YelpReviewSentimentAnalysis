First off even though McBrooms is the place to get beer... D's is a great second option when I want to get something nicer or when McBrooms is closed. Anything from a case to a single bottle whenever you need it already chilled no strings attached. Prices are fair for the service too and a walk-in beer cooler is definitely a plus. Also the hot dog selection is great for both carnivores and vegetarians. My two favorites being the Chihuahua dog and the red alert dog. Spicy spicy.
