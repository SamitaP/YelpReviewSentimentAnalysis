The East End Food Co-Op is a great place to shop and somewhere I frequent reguarly. They have a full selection of products but add a different local flare to things! I find their produce is always fresh and they have a great selection of organic fruits and vegetables as well.One of my favorite parts about the East End Food Co-Op is The Co-op Caf√©. They have a variety of soups entrees and sides to choose from plus a great salad bar. Whether I have time to sit down and enjoy my meal or take it to go they have a little bit of everything and it's all FRESH! This is one of my favorite places to shop!
