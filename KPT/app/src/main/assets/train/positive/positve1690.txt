During our recent visit to Pittsburgh I really wanted to try this place again.  Our first visit last year was great and there were more items on the menu I wanted to try.  It did not disappoint!  We had Italian Wedding soup that was wonderful and my wife just had to try to re-create this when we got home.  Their greens and beans is a special treat with lots of flavor -- an excellent side dish for my main dish spaghetti and meatballs. Now I would not usually order this at most Italian restaurants but Chef Dan does an excellent job with perfectly cooked pasta a fresh marinara sauce and a huge tasty meatball.  And to wrap up I just HAD to have the caramel apple pie a-la-mode.  I don't normally have dessert but I've SEEN and HAD this pie before.  Yummy!  The warm homestyle atmosphere does not prevent me from feeling special when I dine here. The staff treated me like family and I'll be visiting again!
