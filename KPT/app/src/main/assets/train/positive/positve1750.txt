We came here with a friend before a show at Stage AE and had a great dinner. Their steak is terrific as are their bbq pork quesadillas. Desserts are all amazing too (i recommend the peanut butter mousse). We've been to 3 Atria's so far and they've all been good but this was the best. Cool decor and great service too.
