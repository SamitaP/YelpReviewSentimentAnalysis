How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered but definitely homey and sturdy.Randy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7 so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs sausage and gravy-ed potatoes) red cabbage pork chops sauerkraut and potato pancakes. The brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). The food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy healthy or particularly remarkable but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT. A really fun place if showing it's age (though remorselessly).
