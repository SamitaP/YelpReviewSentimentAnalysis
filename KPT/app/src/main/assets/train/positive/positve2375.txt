Tourist perspective:The beers were flowing here. Dozens of microbrews that I need to get to know better as well as Guinness black and tans and Unibroue Terribl√©...a 10.5% ABV 12 oz challice of dark strong flavorful brew.  Pints are $5-8 depening on how obscure a beer you are ordering.  But there is crazy selection.  Try something different. Did you know in this town....and I guess in this state you don't buy your beer in the grocery store?  You gotta go to spots like this for a sixer.  If you need a beer pint or to-go this is an effin' cool spot. mix and match a sixer.We tried a bunch of dogs wings and beers.  The crew here managed to keep our glasses full even though it was packed on st. patrick's day.We tried a few dogs: the mac and cheese brat (with bacon)....really! bacon mac n cheese on an effin' hotdog a bacon cheddar brat and something called the mason-dixon which was french fries & coleslaw on a dog.  All the dogs were good eats.  You can get your order vienna veggie turkey cheese brat or on a spicy dog.  The dogs arrive well grilled with a little bit of crisp blackening going on.  There are a shit load of additional toppings you can request (avacado bacon various mustards saurkraut etc.) and they seemed to be free...at least we didn't get charged anything additional .....Everything was included in the dog prices.Wings were ok.  We did dry wings: jerk spicy ranch and parmesean.  They were all decently meaty.  The parmeseans with a side of the spicy mayo were good stuff distinct flavor and good for dipping.  The other flavors of dry wings were ok. Mostly just salty but ok.
