What is there to say about D's that has not been said?It's a fixture.  The food is remarkably good for pub food and the beer cave is a fun thing. The waitstaff are usually very good and parking in regent square isn't hard to find.  I also have found the bathrooms pretty damn clean for a bar whenever I need to pee.I hope D's is with us for decades to come.
