Solid if not fantastic Italian food. But the best part is it's right beside PNC Park. It's fun to sit outside and listen to a game going on while you munch. The seafood was much better than I'd have thought for such a touristy spot. Sometimes you just hit a place at the right time in the right mood and everything works out great--you get exactly the kind of food you were hoping for in a relaxing atmosphere and you just feel happy. This was the case when my wife and I had dinner here with my son on the first day of one of our trips to Pittsburgh. Oh and they have a good beer selection.
