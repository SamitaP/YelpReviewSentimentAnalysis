How have I never been here before?  How have I never even heard of Legends?  No more.   I went here for lunch and it was delicious!  The location = little scary especially if you would go at night.  The atmosphere = not top notch.  The food = excellent.   I was very pleasantly surprised with my entire meal.  The bread with the rosemary dipping oil was quite good.  The salad was also very tasty.  It had blue cheese and roasted red peppers which I can't get enough of and no iceberg lettuce in sight.  I opted for the spinach and ricotta ravioli in a basil tomato cream sauce.  It was very good.   Not the best I've ever had but solid.  Lots of sauce to dip more of the tasty bread in.   Did I let it end there?  Of course not.  I had a giant slice of apple pie with ice cream.  The apples were sliced a little too thickly for my liking but it was a darn good slice of apple pie and that's coming from someone who makes an out of this world homemade apple pie.Needless to say I didn't get much work done that afternoon because I could barely move.
