Every. Single. Time.  Every single time I've ever been in the Dor-Stop I have been nothing but impressed.  On my most recent visit I ordered the Guy's Version Jumbot and my friend ordered The eggs benedict.  I received an absolutely ridiculous amount of food which was the best breakfast scambler-esque item I've ever eaten and my friend was met with a bit of an unconvential eggs benedict served on a large piece of italian toast with basted eggs instead of the traditional poached.The service was standard for a restaurant like this the server had large sections (two servers splitting the entire floor.)  but they were surprisingly on top of us and when your bill is roughly 15 dollars for two people how can you lose?
