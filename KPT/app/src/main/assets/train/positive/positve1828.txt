I can't believe this place has not been reviewed yet.  If you live in beechview you already know about this place but if you don't you need to try this place out if you are passing through.At first glance you will barely notice the bar/restaurant from the exterior.  Inside it is your typical Pittsburgh bar with a some additional seating in the back.  So you would think why take the time to review this place.  Well they have a old-fashion popcorn machine which they offer free while you are drinking at the bar and this popcorn was phenomenal.  But it only gets better happy hour pints for 90 cents.  So delicious popcorn + beer= Great afternoon after work.  Well at this point I was like wow this little place well served its purpose for a cheap happy hour on my way home from work. And then: The Reuben.  Now I am not the connoisseur of Reubens but this one was absolutely flavorful.All in All- check this place out if you are in the area and need to grab a cold one.
