I have been eating their sauerbraten since I was a little girl.  I love this place.  I love the old-fashioned decor the room setup makes you feel as if you're in an old house and there is a piano that plays itself by the bar if you feed it a quarter.if you're a first time visitor i reccomend their wonderful sampler platter that allows you to choose 3 (i think) entrees and some sides.superyum!
