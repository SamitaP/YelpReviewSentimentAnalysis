Probably the best German restaurant in Pittsburgh.There's nothing I like better than meat it ties grains for the best food group in the pyramid (I reject the plate). We got the sausage platter Bavarian stuffed pretzel and the Max's sampler platter. I'm still drooling over their stuffed pretzels.  I think what won me over as the basket full of bread. Not only was there a surplus of meat but also bread?? Free? Indescribable happiness.
