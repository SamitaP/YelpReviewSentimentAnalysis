The food is simply four-star good but the atmosphere and service are definitely worth a star all by themselves. Max's is cozy in a neighborhood hangout kind of way with a menu that will hit the spot if nouvelle is not your favorite cuisine.  They do have a vegetarian sandwich but we went for the potato pancake reubens (turkey and regular) with onion rings and apple sauce and were very pleased.  The pancake batter is on the floury side so they are more pancake than latke but they were good nonetheless.  If I lived a little closer I'd be here all the time - local North Side brews and a menu I'm looking forward to exploring from top to bottom. They even have my favorite dessert from when I was little Black Forest cake so you know I'll be back for that.
