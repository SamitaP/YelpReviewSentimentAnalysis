This is the McDonald's to end all McDonald's in my book. Here's why:~ The Drive-Thru is crazy fast.~ There are 2 Drive-Thru lanes to keep it crazy fast.~ Even when they have to make my dog's special no-onion cheeseburger they are crazy fast.~ For years they gave my family's dog Jamie free baby ice cream cones. Jamie didn't need many moments of excitement to be happy but 'go for ride' was one of them and 'ice cream time' was another.~ The drive-thru staff is so sweet to my little pup Lucy when I take her to 'cheeseburger window'.So I guess what I'm saying is this is the best McDonald's for dogs and their parents. And as someone who generally only visits McDonald's to reward my dog for good behavior after a vet visit this McDonald's is just right.
