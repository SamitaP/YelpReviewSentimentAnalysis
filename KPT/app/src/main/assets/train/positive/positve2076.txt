We met friends there for breakfast yesterday (they were able to accommodate our group of five by having one of us sit on the windowsill but he's thin; ha ha) and we LOVED the Dor-Stop!  It's not very large and it's *very* popular (we arrived at 9:00 a.m. [on a Sunday] and it was already very crowded which we normally wouldn't want to bother with.  However; we knew about that situation in advance and actually we didn't have to wait too terribly long for a table).I ordered a vegetarian (three-egg) omelette with egg whites which came with toast & hash browns - and my husband ordered a vegetarian burrito.  We both ordered coffee too.  The food was *delicious* & portions were quite sufficient and the coffee was pretty good (a little too weak but better than at most diners [and also more expensive at $1.89]).Our server was *terrific*; she had a great sense of humor (we had a very amusing conversation with her) and she was also very attentive.  The people at the cash register (who also took names for tables) were friendly too.  Afterwards I complimented the wife half of the owner couple (who have owned the Dor-Stop for 26 years) and also their daughter & the (three) cooks.  All of them were very friendly and the cooks had a great sense of humor.Our (two) meals cost $22.17 with tax (but before the tip).  The restroom was clean too.
