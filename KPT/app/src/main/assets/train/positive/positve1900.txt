Beto's Pizza is definitely my go-to pizza in Dormont even though I have to hop in my car and drive down there. Trust me the drive back always seems like it takes forever because I feel so weighed down from their delicious pizza.Beto's is a little unorthodox when it comes to your traditional pie of pizza. First they sell pizza by the square slice ( which isn't so unorthodox I know) and second their pizza comes out with the cheese uncooked on top of the hot crust along with any other toppings you might fancy. So yes you will eat your pizza with uncooked cheese on it. And yes YOU WILL LIKE IT.Beto's breaks the holier-than-thou commandments of pizza with their methods of pizza production and while indulging yourself with their pizza it never felt so right.Try eating more than four pieces I dare you.
