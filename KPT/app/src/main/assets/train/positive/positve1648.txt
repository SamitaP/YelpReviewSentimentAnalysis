What a gem! I don't know if this is a new place or people just haven't heard of it but my party and I came here. It's quite small but it was BYOB and the food was amazing! I had the ahi tuna special and it was fresh and delicious. Everyone else seemed very pleased with their meals as well. I'd love to eat here again if I had another chance to go to Pittsburgh. Staff was also very friendly despite finding out I was from Michigan and a Red Wings fan.
