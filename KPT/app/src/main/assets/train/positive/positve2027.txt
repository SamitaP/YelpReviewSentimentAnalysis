Oh man this place is awesome! You get to choose what type of pancakes you want so I chose banana chocolate chip and they were delicious and huge. You get three pancakes and I had to take two home to finish later. My friend got the stuffed French toast with bacon and again delicious.The food came fast but the waitress wasn't all that attentive. She was pleasant enough but we received no coffee or water refills. That's pretty much the only complaint. If you're in the area definitely stop and check this out.
