I have not been to the Triangle for more than 20 years but have told my husband about it many times (the place I used to go in college with friends late at night that had amazing hoagies named after ships - destroyers battleship etc.).  He had never been there and never heard of the Triangle.  Today was my lucky day!  We went to Kennywood and I realized the Triangle was just over the bridge.  My husband a big Danny's fan was game to try it.  The neighborhood is a bit sketchy but parking was easy and the Triangle was exactly as I remembered it especially the orange and green tiled floor!We ordered a battleship and a cheesesteak destroyer.  Everyone (kids grandpa) loved them.  They were even better than I remember - fantastic fresh bread stuffed with meat and cheese lettuce and tomato just the right amount of oil and vinegar salt and pepper.  Like other people say you'd think that such a sandwich would be easy to find but for some reason good simple  things (basic awesome bread) are hard to come by.  The cheesesteak was fantastic as well.  We felt that the cheesesteak was better than Danny's.  We have NOTHING like this in the west.  Definitely a great place a fantastic  price oh and Turner's iced tea too!  I just hope I don't have to wait another 20 years for my next one.
