(Only commenting on Ri Ra as a bar as I have not tried the food) Get some more staff! This place is terribly understaffed on a Friday night there should not be only 2 bartenders for a packed bar. Easily takes 10 min to get a drink. I like the space and the patio but it means nothing if I can't get a drink.
