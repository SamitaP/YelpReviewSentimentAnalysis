Service was extremely slow. We sat at our table for quite a while before we were waited on. Once we ordered the server brought cornbread right away. It's good but not what I was expecting. We both ordered the fried chicken. It was cold and soggy. The mac and cheese was good but again it's Mac and cheese. The server was really sweet but not attentive to the table. Food was just ok. Wouldn't go back.
