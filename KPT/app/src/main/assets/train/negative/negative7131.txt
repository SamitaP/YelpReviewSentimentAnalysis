Pamela's is the hottest thing in Pittsburgh and they have lines of an hour long going out the door they don't take reservations But I'm not sure why they have such high ratings. After waiting for an hour to get seated we were expecting good food and in reality everything was drenched in butter. Everything was super greasy buttery. Even their hotcakes (which are like crepes - love crepes) they look great but once you taste them it's all butter. Our party also tried the French toast and hash browns and those were super greasy too and didn't taste good at all. The reason it's so busy is because it's the only show in town. There are a few of them and there's really nowhere else to go. It's sad. Being from NJ and having many diners that compete with each other there are some good tasting Diners making good French toast crepes and hash browns. This was just a joke and DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT. The service on the other hand was very good and workers were very nice and helpful.
