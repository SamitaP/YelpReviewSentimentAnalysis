OVERALL:Given the popularity of Girasole I was disappointed that this place didn't even come close to living up to the hype. Although there were some highlights there were plenty of negatives to counter them.SERVICE:Despite having a reservation we were made to wait for over 45 minutes for a table standing outside in the cold. Also we were only given cutlery for two of the three people in our party. Not a good start. Once seated though the service was good. Our server Vito was pleasant and attentive.FOOD:Disappointing. The bread brought to our table was stone cold and the accompanying butter was rock hard and still in the commercial packaging. I expect to get butter in little plastic tubs at a diner but not at a relatively upscale restaurant like Girasole. Furthermore the fact that the bread was cold and the butter was practically frozen made it impossible to spread. Not a good start. Fortunately it improved from there. The salad course was the highlight of the meal - the greens were crisp and the addition of sunflower seeds and bleu cheese crumbles gave it wonderful texture and flavor. This was the best part of the meal.My steak was tender and the meat was of good quality. However it was a tad under-seasoned and the accompanying risotto was undercooked and quite bland. The polenta that was served with my wife's chicken was also bland and under-seasoned. Desserts were average. I had the chocolate mousse cake which sounded delicious but ultimately the quality was on par with what you would get at a supermarket bakery. My wife had the coconut cream cake which turned out to just be yellow cake with some coconut frosting.AMBIANCE: Probably the best thing about this place. It is quaint and intimate. The decor is charming and it's in a lovely location.FINAL VERDICT:Probably a better bet on an off-peak night and when the weather is nicer but if it's a busy night and it's cold out I'd give it a miss.
