McCormick & Schmick's knockoff is the best way to describe this completely non-memorable place. I agree with the other person who said it's trying to be a swanky hotel bar/restaurant. That may sound dumb but as someone who frequents hotels & their restaurants it can easily go either way. I've found you can get a great read on a place by the vibe of a hotel lounge. I hope for Pittsburgh this is not the case. Did I expect more from a Westin? Yes. Am I surprised? No.Sub-par sushi. Tasted like takeout from Wegmans (holler Rochester!). My Sauv Blanc was room temp & obviously an old bottle because it tasted nothing like it should (Kim Crawford is my standby so this was extra disappointing). Walk across the street & check out the Tonic Bar I wish I had.
