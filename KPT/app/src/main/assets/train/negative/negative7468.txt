Most fast food places fall in the the meh category for me. They get the job done but sometimes they are slow or the bathroom is rank or the fries are soggy or something. This McDonald's is by far the worst fast food experience I've ever had. They had about 3-5 employees working at around 12 am on a Saturday night. There were about 15 of us in line and it took over an hour to get our food...... An hour for fast food. I could have went into an ihop and had two sit down meals during that time frame and filled up gas. The employees did not seem to care and had no sense to work faster. Didn't feel like they spoke English well and an overall sense of indifference towards the customers. I would avoid this McDonald's at all costs a below mediocre McDonald's with probably terrible management allowing the employees to be so apathetic and worried only about getting their hours in. AVOID!!
