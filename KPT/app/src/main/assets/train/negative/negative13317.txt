This place is bad! The service is bad the food is bad and the prices are high! With our party of 4 we had a similar experience as Christina L. Where different waiters/waitresses would come by and awkwardly take our order then someone else would bring out that order and then someone else would arrive to help us further.. The crab rangoons were very small and tasted generic like something I could buy frozen at food lion and the shrimp in our meals ALSO were not deveined... And every dish we ordered was flavorless and bland... The only thing I enjoyed was the wonton soup! And then at the end of our meal around 9:45pm we stayed at the table to chat.. Being cautious that the restaurant hours printed on the door said they close at 11pm.. A waitress came to us at 10pm and said that they were closing and they needed us to pay now... O_o  So we got up to pay and leave and the cashier man ( looked like the manager ) was so cold.. He never asked how the food was or anything just this how much! And swiped the cards... Such a waste of money and time.. Worst Chinese food ever!
