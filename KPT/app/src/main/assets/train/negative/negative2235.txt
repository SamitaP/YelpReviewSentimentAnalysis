Meh. At best. So I went to Bado's tonight w/ my dad and sister and it was a bit lackluster. I started out with chicken noodle soup (w/ no noodles) and a very spicy bloody ( I know. I know. I am an avid evening bloody mary drinker.) The bloody mary was pretty awesome for what I assume is a pre-made mix. I also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell! Iceberg lettuce croutons cucumbers and dry swordfish. Lame. My dad got a meatball casserole which is something I would have never ordered...meatballs and casserole aren't a selling point for me let alone as a package deal.  This meatball casserole dish was just pasta and meatballs...thankfully for my dads heart. My sister got a salad (again just iceberg lettuce croutons cucumbers) with chicken fingers.  She also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average. I guess pizza is what Bados is known for so you should just stick with that if you go.  Pro: Spicy bloody marys decent pizza cute waiter wide beer selectionCon: bland salads noodleless noodle soups not many healthy options no dinner entrees besides pasta
