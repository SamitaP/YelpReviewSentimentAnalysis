Ate here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday. We had a party of approx. 10 people. We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice considering it was primetime on a Saturday night.That was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server from beginning to end was slow. I would post his name but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken cheese bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID however like their food.Going back to the service several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. Our best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18% but in the end I opted against it.Definitely will not return.
