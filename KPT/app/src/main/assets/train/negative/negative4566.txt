This place is a blast on St Patricks Day and to see a band play.  It gets packed.  Mullaneys has been around for a long time -- possibly the oldest Irish pub I'm aware of.  It's never changed.  I love coming here--for beer and whiskey.Today I came here for lunch.  I'd never had the food before.  It was just okay.  I ordered the crab caprese salad and you dont get very much for what it cost and the server was charming and Irish but the service was incredibly slow.  It took an hour and a half for lunch.I think I'll only come here for drinking and fun as a dining destination youve got so many other options in the Strip District!...also while I dont want the bar to change it is looking incredibly worn.  Its in dire need of new paint and new flooring lest it become a dive bar.TWO STARS BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS DIRTY.  Its very dirty.  So dirty.  Maybe they  dont notice it at night during the bulk of their business.  Inch of dusk on the window sill.  So gross.  Please please clean the bar.
