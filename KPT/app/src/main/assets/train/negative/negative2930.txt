I only went here to have a few drinks and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours just drinking and if our waitress could of re-worded her words our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated I'm leaving here is the check if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar. So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says  IM LEAVING I need you to pay your check. At this point me being me gets a little annoyed as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do and we continued the night as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great the food looked good but your sour mouth ruined it all.
