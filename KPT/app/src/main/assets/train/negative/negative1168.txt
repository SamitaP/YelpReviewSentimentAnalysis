I'm going to revise my review of Quiet Storm.You may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich. In my experience however (considering the 30+ Cubanos I've eaten there) you're more likely to get a sad mediocre rendition.Consistency is not their strong point.Add to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude and I've decided to steer clear.It's a shame that I no longer feel it's worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at Quiet Storm. It's also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful friendly and helpful and yet their efforts are overshadowed.Sorry Quiet Storm. As a Pittsburgh vegetarian I want to love you. But you broke my heart.
