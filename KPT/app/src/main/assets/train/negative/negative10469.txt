Meh. I've experienced better. Don't go for the jerk chicken. It looked like brownstew and It just wasn't that good. The greens were okay. I would try something else...IF I go back. Also the lady at the register was holding a personal conversation on the phone while I placed my order and waited to get my food. What's up with that?
