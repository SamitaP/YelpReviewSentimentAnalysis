I am only giving this two stars because I believed the hype. The burger I had was good but it wasn't the best I've ever had and the menu--even for a carnivore like me---was too meat heavy. And we had to wait to be seated and it was not super cheap so all these things combined make me less than thrilled with the experience. Perhaps if I had the burger cooked medium rare things would be different but I still crown Industry reigning king of all (Pitts) burgers. However things are not bad by any means they just aren't the absolute best as I was hoping for. And there wasn't enough bread to hold the burger causing me to do the unthinkable and use a knife! The highlight of the night though was hearing a man refer to his wife as my darling when she wasn't even within earshot.
