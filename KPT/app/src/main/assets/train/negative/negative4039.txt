I'm really torn by this review. For years and years this was my favorite restarant in the downtown area. We went there last Saturday for dinner and had what I would deem an average meal at exorbitant prices. The salads while tasty were much smaller than I had remembered previously.  The side dishes again were seemingly smaller to not only me but our party as well. Unfortunately the worst part of my meal were the steaks. For $45 I received a New York Strip that was WAY overpriced (my wife makes it all the time and much much better) and was in a word chewy. The service overall was quite good unless you like a car valet (they don't have it). Next time I'll try Morton's or Capital Grille.
