Pass.  I tried Lemon Grass for takeout and was as disappointed as many of my fellow Yelpers here.  The Pad Thai was bland and generic and tasted almost gummy.  The coconut lemon grass soup had slightly more flavor but it left a really greasy feeling in my mouth.  To top it all off while I was waiting for my food I had to endure being hit on by the host.  To be fair it's not like they were all that busy so I guess it gave him something to do.  And I wouldn't have minded if the food had been amazing.  But sadly it wasn't.  And it wasn't cheap either.
