A year later prices have increased 70% and the quality of food have declined. Customer service is still superb though. Today I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps 25% beef in dish only there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish and was drenched in oil. Another dish red curry with chicken was always lacking chicken pieces they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad. Sad to say this used to be my favorite place but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another Thai place to be our go-to.
