Went last night with in-laws for mother in laws bday.We always have loved the place and it is our go to place when we have something to celebrate and even when we don't.  Walked right in we're seated server was pleasant. Mentioned it was for mother in laws birthday and she was nice about it.Ordered drinks and an appetizer. ..This is where things went slightly pear shaped. Server came back and told us the appetizer was delayed. No big beal things happen. Food comes and as always was completely wonderful. Chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers. More pear shaped waitress was no where to be found for 20 minutes. Wife was out of beer and spicy food minus drink.....she waited. Finally I got up and had to get another server to get a refill. She started with I am not your server.... but said she would take care of it. To her credit she did. Manager comes over very nice apologized for the appetizer and days she will cover it. Server shows up and is rather standoffish. Not rude per se but moody. Not sure if it was my stunt with the beer or the manager but either way not our fault. More waiting for desert more drinks something and then the server does show up with the bill no questions asked not a thing.The rating is not for the appetizer  like I said things happen. It was not for the lack of drinks it was for the apathy. At least come by and check on us tell us the app is coming but the server seemed to say the app screwed my tip so why try. If the place was hopping I would get it but it was early afternoon. Anyway long story short: great food apathetic service use to be a go to place even with the hour drive but we may be finding another one.
