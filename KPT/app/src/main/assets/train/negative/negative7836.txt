We got here a little before 5 PM hoping to beat the crowd and not have to wait to be seated-The place was empty except for the 5 or 6 parties ahead of us in the waiting area who made the same mistake-We were expected to happily wait until 5 when more servers would start work-We left.Don't pretend to be open and not be ready to serve hungry customers!I like the food here and think it's a pretty good value for the $60 or so we spend for the two of usbut there's lots of other places to spend that money-
