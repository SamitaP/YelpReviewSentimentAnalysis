I was so disappointed with the quality... the salad was drenched in vinegar the duck was mediocre.  I guess I'm used to really good food from foodie towns.  If I wanted mediocre food I would go to fridays or olive garden-- was it comparable?  Yes for quality of food.  The price obviously was much more.  This fake fusion place would have gone out of business regardless of price if it had to compete with the likes of Slanted Door or was located in a city with good food.  If this is representative of the best Pittburgh has to offer then take the money you would have spent here and reinvest it in a trip to SF or NYC and eat well for a week. How sad is that?  Don't go here... you pay $30 for an entree $10 for an appetizer and $15 for a mediocre wine.  Not worth it...
