So I am currently sitting here with Pho Minh's Pho tai...and I honestly have to say I am not impressed.  Its a monday and my favorite Pho place (Tram's...in pittsburgh anyway) is closed.I decided to give this place a go...and take out their pho...The broth is actually good very light yet flavorful.  But the noodles are a disgrace.  They are lumpy smooshy and not at all chewy...they just kind of dissolve once you put it in your mouth and they take up none of the broth's flavor.  I also ordered some fresh shrimp spring rolls that were halfway falling apart when I got them and barely any shrimp.All in all I'll come back if im desperate for Pho on a Monday but otherwise...nay
