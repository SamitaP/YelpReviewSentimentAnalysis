I am a big fan of breakfast & brunch so I am always on the lookout for new options.  One Sunday I decided to check this place out instead of going to my usual brunch place.  Sad to say this was a big mistake.  For me they did not have a good breakfast/brunch menu.. the offerings were very limited in comparison to other area brunch spots. But I found something that sounded ok and placed my order.  Unfortunately the service was very slow and I waited forever for my food to come out - and it was not even anything special - scrambled eggs home-fries and toast.  Even worse than the slow service was the fact that my food was cold and flavorless.   The price point was not bad but I will not be back because I was not at all happy with the quality of the food.
