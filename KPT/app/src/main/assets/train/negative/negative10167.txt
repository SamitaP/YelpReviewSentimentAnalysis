Went here on a football Sunday and I was told that the menu was reduced to be quick and more American. This was a disappointment to me as I would not mind waiting for some good French cuisine. I ordered the only traditional plate left on the menu avoiding the burgers and fries... it was good but there are better places and better food. I don't know much about about French food so I was curious. The music was too loud an rappish (or R&B) so although I dined alone I would imagine it would be difficult to carry a conversation. The staff was friendly and service good but that is not enough to bring me back so I will not repeat.
