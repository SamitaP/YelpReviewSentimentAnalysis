Average to mediocre pizza.  I had a beer and the Bronx Bomber and never tasted a pizza this salty before.  And if the oven is wood fired they are doing it a grave injustice with the dough they use for the crust. It was sort of pasty white and bland with absolutely no character to it.  I know it is my personal bias but I prefer a crust that has some big air bubbles and an oven hot enough to char it just a bit All in all I was disappointed by the food.  The two stars are because of the good service.
