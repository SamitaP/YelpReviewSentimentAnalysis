We were skeptical to eat here based on the mixed reviews. We can now say we've tried it and we probably won't go back. We were greeted by a hostess who sounded and smelled like she just got done smoking. Instead of escorting us to a seat she told us which tables to pick and to seat ourselves. I ordered the sirloin of beef with mashed potatoes and my fiance got the steak and eggs. The food was just okay. Our server was friendly and attentive. We were thankful we didn't have one of the other servers who was clearly dying of pneumonia or bronchitis or something. She was coughing up a lung in front of everyone and sniffling every 5 seconds. She washed her hands a lot but the hostess did not wash her hands upon returning from smoking outside. Kind of gross if you ask me.
