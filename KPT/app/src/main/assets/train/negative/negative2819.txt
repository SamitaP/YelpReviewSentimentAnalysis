I am not a big fan of seafood so it takes a lot to win me over.I tried several of the dishes at Original Fish Market including the lobster bisque the halibut and the pork-chop with coleslaw.  The lobster bisque was bland and cold.  The halibut was decent.  The pork chop was so bitter and dry.The whole atmosphere of the place seemed standoff-ish and was not friendly.  Furthermore it took forever just to get our waitress's attention.  When we finally got her to look our way she was short with us.  It was as if we bothered her.  I would rather go get sushi than spend more money here.
