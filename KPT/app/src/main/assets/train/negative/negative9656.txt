I was really excited to checkout Brixx.  I had heard some great things about it.  We hit the 6th Street location.  My friends arrived before me and had their beers for 20 minutes.  10 minutes after I arrived the waiter finally brought me a glass of water then he flew off before we could order anything.  25 MINUTES later we finally got his attention to request the bill. We had reached the point of frustration where we were so angry that we didn't want to order anything or give them our business.  The fastest part of the afternoon was when he brought the bill waited and closed us out.  He did not receive a tip.  I have never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant in my entire life.
