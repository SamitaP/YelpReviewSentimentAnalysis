I have continued going back to Elbow Room hoping for a different experience. No matter how many times I order from them they always leave something off my burger. I do not understand how a burger with apple cheese and bacon always end up missing at least one of the 3 items. I am just happy it has the burger on it. So tired of this place. I have talked to their chefs and managers about this issue and it has never been resolved. If you get takeout from this place I suggest always opening your box before you leave to make sure it is all there.
