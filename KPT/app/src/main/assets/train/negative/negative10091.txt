I stopped in here for lunch. The food was just average and service was awful. They were very understaffed - it took about 10 minutes for the server to take my order and then about another 40 minutes to get my food. I was in a bit of a rush so ended up speed eating. I had a Greek salad and it was just ok. Ingredients were fresh but the chicken was pretty dry. No bueno.
