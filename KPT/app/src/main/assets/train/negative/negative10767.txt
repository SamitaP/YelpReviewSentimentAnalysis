I ordered carryout at Maharani on my way home from work; I ordered the Murg Curry and garlic naan. The chicken in the murg curry was extremely dry and tough the sauce was pretty bland and the garlic naan tasted like it had been baked the day before and left to sit out overnight before it was put in my carry-out bag. The bar for Indian food has been set pretty high for me; I've cooked many Indian meals at home and have tried dozens of different Indian restaurants but even still the food at Maharani was pretty poor. I give it two stars instead of one because the staff was very friendly and the decor when I went in was very tasteful. I'm hoping at some point I can brave going back and dining in perhaps getting a different dish and can raise my rating to 3 or 4 stars.
