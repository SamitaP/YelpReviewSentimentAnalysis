I think this restaurant fits american taste. Because i was the only non american to eat here just now even though the seats are fully occupiedIt doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine it is very chinese. And i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant. The sushi is not even firmly madeI am not saying the food is bad it is actually alrightBut they have a great interior and place
