Strange little place hidden on 5th St. in uptown that for some reason stays packed. Of course it's not really hard to pack this place as small as it is. It does seem to be popular though probably mainly due to the scenery of the bartenders. Unfortunately you only get a glimpse of them as you grab a drink and try to stay out of the crush. And good luck getting back to your group or your table without spilling half of your drink if you are lucky enough to find a place to sit.Live bands and more often DJs are in there spinning some decent tunes but Phil's is more often a staging point for the rest of the evening a springboard to bigger places and better things.
