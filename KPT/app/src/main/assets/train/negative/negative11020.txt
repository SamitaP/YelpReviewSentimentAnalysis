This might be the worst Chinese I've ever tasted in my life...and i'm a college student so I've had a lot. I don't have a car so i ordered the sesame chicken and the beef with broccoli to go...two of my favorite standby dishes. the sesame was way too battered and was smothered with the sauce so much that i was literally scraping it off. it's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff...nasty. and the beef with broccoli was worse! it tasted like the  brown sauce was day old gravy and the meat was like the mystery meat that you'd get at a middle school cafeteria. on second though i think my cafeteria was better. and the broccoli tasted acidic. it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza. seriously don't go here.
