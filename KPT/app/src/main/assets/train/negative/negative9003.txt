When we first moved to Charlotte NC from Savannah I was really looking forward to trying Southern food here. A lot of people suggested Mert's. One word-YUCK! We ordered simple items. Fried chicken macaroni and cheese and collards. The chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland. The service wasn't great either. She leaned over our tablewith her butt in the other patrons face the entire time. Not impressed. I went a second time just in case they were having a bad day. I ordered catfish with okra and tomatoes. Again-YUCK! The catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it. The okra and tomatoes were alright. Still searching for a great southern restaurant.
