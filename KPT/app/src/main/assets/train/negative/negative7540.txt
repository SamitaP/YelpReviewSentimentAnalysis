Stay away. Since my review nearly a year ago this place has gone from bad to worse. Every order is wrong. The problem exists at both the ordering process in the drive through but also in the order picking by staff even if the order was right. How sad. This is the worst McDonald's and worst customer service of any restaurant in any category. Here's what to expect:Long linesRude customer service that claim its the customer's faultIncorrect orders every timeCold friesThis is one of the restaurants I worry about that spits in food that retaliate insteed of fixing problems. They have added convenient waiting stations for your car to park so that they can hopefully match the order with the car. Too bad even then the orders are not right. What's worse? Nothing changes even when they aren't busy. Avoid this location.
