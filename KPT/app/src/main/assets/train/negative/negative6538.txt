My husband and I tried Harris Grill for the first time on a Sunday night. We moved to the area in August and are moving away in June and unfortunately decided we won't be coming back here before we leave. There was only one very small table open in the crammed dining room downstairs when we got there. I'm not sure if there were tables open upstairs but it didn't look like the hostess checked before seating us. Our table was facing the door so I kept feeling the cold air every time people came in and out and we were very close to the table behind us beside us etc. We eventually asked to move but I thought the hostess should've asked us if that table was okay before seating us there - because I would've rather waited for a better one to open up.I thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor. I wanted an entree rather than a salad or a sandwich but since I didn't feel like Mexican or a huge plate of macaroni & cheese there were really only a handful of options. None of them appealed to me so I ended up ordering the Henny Penny a chicken sandwich. I asked for the spicy chipotle mayonnaise on the side because I have a really low tolerance for spiciness. When it came the mayonnaise was on the sandwich. I said I would try it in case it wasn't that spicy but when I took a bite I felt like my mouth was on fire! Then the waitress asked me if I knew the chicken itself was spicy. The menu said nothing about that so I had no idea. She suggested they re-make it with plain chicken which was nice and it was fine after that. I also had the sangria which sounded like it would be amazing from the description but I actually didn't think it was good at all :( It tasted really watered down to me. A few redeeming things: the mac & cheese that came with my sandwich was really really good! My husband liked the fish tacos he had and three different people checked up on me after the incident with my sandwich so we at least felt like the staff was pretty attentive.
