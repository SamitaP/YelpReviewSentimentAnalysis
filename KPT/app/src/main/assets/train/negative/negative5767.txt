It was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat.  Stopped by Fiori's haven't been there in years.  Yes it was crowded but got a table and ordered pizza and wings.  The pizza was hard to chew the crust was hard the cheese was too!  The pizza was just sweet without much other taste almost like ketchup!  Definitely not a fan of sweet pizza...I don't know why it is so popular but most people tend to like sweet food and drinks...but not me...I want some flavors and spice!The wings were so average....not anything I would order again....my son ate one and said he was done...amazing!I know! I know! this place is popular but it is just is not for me!
