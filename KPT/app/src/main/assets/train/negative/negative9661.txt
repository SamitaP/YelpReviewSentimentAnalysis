It's slipped. I was a huge Brixx fan back in the day but it's just not up to par now. Bruschetta was stale over-toasted bread with marinated tomatoes. Salad was somewhat wilted greens drenched in dressing. Interior deserves a renovation. I hope they make it but just think customers expect more especially now.
