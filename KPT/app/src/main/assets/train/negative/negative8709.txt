After two recent visits here I can honestly say I am torn on my review but overall I know I have had better. Most recently we arrived shortly after 12 and were seated indoors because the patio was full and it took our server over 15 minutes to take our drink order. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips which arrived 5 minutes before our food. Before I get to the food the appetizer was cold and came with about 10 chips. Being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa. The chips were warm however the salsa stay away unless you like Pace's from the grocery store. Really are they kidding serving store bought salsa???On to the food.  We ordered a good variety stuffed peppers chicken enchiladas burger and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn! The enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water. Only positive the fries great seasoning!As for the service I wish I took her name but our waitress could have given two sh...about being there and you could tell. No refills never saw her except our order and bill and very blah! Not sure we would return anytime soon.
