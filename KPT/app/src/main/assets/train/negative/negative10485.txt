We used to go to the Emperor years ago with our young children and had fond memories of the place.  It was a mom & pop shop nice ambiance and friendly service at good prices. After some shopping at the Metropolitan my husband wanted to go to the Emperor for a quick dinner.  There were no other diners in the restaurant.  Evidently this place is now pretty much a take-out joint maybe has some lunch business but is not longer a place to enjoy a sit down meal. We were gruffly greeted by the sole person at the desk brought over some fried noodles and duck sauce while we considered the menu.  We ordered the Szechuan Shrimp and Scallops and also the Shrimp in Garlic Sauce.  I will say that the food was plentiful and not bad but I will never go back.  The place appears dirty the service is not friendly.  Never asked if we needed or wanted anything else.  Didn't seem to care about having sit-down customers at all.  Just a bad experience all around.  Gross.
