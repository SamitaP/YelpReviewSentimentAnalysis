I'm a pretty hard core karaoke fan so I was excited to visit Nico's on a Saturday night after hearing about their awesome karaoke. Sadly I was disappointed. The place is rather small and was packed by the time we came (about 10pm). It took ages to get a drink and it's hard to get around the bar with so many people standing around. That said my drink was nice and strong and the prices are reasonable. Now the karaoke crowd was pretty fun...mostly hipsters with a few good singers but mostly people trying to be funny with their song choice. The karaoke host was just lame. He was an older guy and seemed rather cranky and jaded which really kills the mood when you're a karaoke buff looking for a good time. And he had a CD setup -- seriously CDs in 2010. His song list was waaaaaay out of date. He had a tiny TV screen that was setup in such a way that if you needed to look at the words you would be facing away from the crowd. It was just really lackluster in my opinion.
