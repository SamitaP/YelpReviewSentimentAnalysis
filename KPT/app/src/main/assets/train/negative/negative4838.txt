I tried to eat here tonight using a $25 gift certificate purchased from Restaurant.com.  After waiting over 15 minutes for my server to stop by for my order I showed her my gift certificate.  She told me they stopped taking them however I had just purchased it 15 minutes earlier.  I spoke to the manager and he wasn't the least bit interested.  He told me Restaurant.com was a scam (I have used it before with no problems) and he hasn't been able to get in touch with them to cancel.  While I was still talking to him he answered a call on his cell phone without even saying excuse me.  He obviously didn't care at all.I called Restaurant.com for a refund and told them what he said.  They told me that they have actually been trying to get in touch with the restaurant for weeks.  I can only assume he owes them money or something.  Either way it is outrageous that he will not honor a gift certificate for a program he agreed to sign up for.Beyond this problem I can't recommend this place simply based on how awfully they dealt with this issue.  I didn't get a chance to try any food and I never will.
