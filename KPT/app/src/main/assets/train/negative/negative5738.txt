This is one of those places that you really really WANT to like especially if you live nearby.  I have been mostly underwhelmed by the foodexcept for their desserts which are perfection.  They have a very ambitious menu which perhaps does not give the cooks time enough to really focus on making fewer items really well. Sometimes the dinners are good sometimes they are not. The salads are good.  I would only go there to meet a friend for a drink or attend an event that you are invited to going there as dinner date is a real gamble even if you do have a groupon.
