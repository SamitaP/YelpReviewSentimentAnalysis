This is a very odd restaurant.  I was here once and probably won't be back.  The people who work here were doing a lot of screaming at each other we were the only 2 people in the restaurant but our food took about 45 minutes to come and the quality of the food wasn't that great.  You can definitely get better Vietnamese elsewhere in the city.With all the wonderful dining options in the Strip I'm confused as to how this place survives.
