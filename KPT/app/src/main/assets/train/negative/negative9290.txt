I've been to this restaurant for several other business dinners but this visit was the most unsatisfactory visit.Fresh off a 5 hour flight we checked into our hotels and went straight to dinner at 8pm. We were famished after our flight.The meal started out great. We ordered the LOCAL ANTIPASTO PLATTER with assorted dry cured 100% berkshire meats olives sweet and salty pickles and toasted bread. It was delicious!We took our time to enjoy the appetizer while chatting. When we finished our appetizers 20 minutes later we looked around for our waiter expecting our dinners. He immediately came over and apologized that our 2 dinner entree order went in after a large table's order and he was working on getting our orders rushed through. Unfortunately our table didn't receive any bread so we had to ask for it to tie us over. He looked perplexed why we didn't get bread but made sure a basket was brought over immediately. Don't know if it was because we were starved but the house bread was yummy with peach butter spread.It was almost another 20-30 minutes before he brought out our dinners. He exclaimed that it was an ordeal trying to get our entrees. REALLY?!? Sounds like poor kitchen line management that should be corrected. Hell's kitchen wouldn't stand for it. - PECAN CRUSTED SNAKE RIVER TROUT: hearty portions/ over blackened- PAN ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS: right portion size but toooo salty- LOCAL SQUASH & ZUCCHINI WITH SWEET VIDALIA ONIONS: over cooked and mushy.Our waiter Adam was very nice and checked in on our table several times throughout dinner. He apologized several times and we understood it was out of his hands. The restaurant GM should have made an appearance to our table. Lucky we didn't have clients with us this evening. Poor kitchen line management explains another reason why business dinners take 3 hours at these types of restaurants.
