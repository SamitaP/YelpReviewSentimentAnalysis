My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. Once we did get seated service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware 3 times for a straw for my sons cup and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of. Oh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience.
