This place has a decent menu it's executed pretty well and they (of course) make their own beers. Too bad it's often packed to the rafters with former frat boy turned middling banking executives who still listen to DMB on the side. I'm happy to eat there if I happen to be uptown and the crowd wants to... but I try to avoid it whenever I can.
