We were visiting Pittsburgh and decided to try out Pamela's for breakfast due to all the great reviews.  Either their aren't many good breakfast joints or people have a very different taste there.  We found the food to be greasy and not particularly good.  I like the idea of thinner crepe style pancakes but these just don't taste good.  On top of it all the coffee was horrible.  Try DeLuca for a diner experience or Crepe Parisiennes for a good crepe and coffee instead.
