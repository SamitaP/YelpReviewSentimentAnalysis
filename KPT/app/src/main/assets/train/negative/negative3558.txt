We (3 in our party) stopped in to Roland's while in the lively and interesting Strip District. We placed our drink and food selections with the waitress. She brought our soups which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls. All were absolutely delicious. The lobster bisque actually had lots of pieces of lobster and the onion soup rich beefy taste with lots of onions. The clam chowder had tons of clams and the portion was large enough for a meal!!! Our shrimp appetizers ...fried shrimp and shrimp cooked in a beer broth were excellent. Unfortunately our server had no clue how to actually serve people in a restaurant...we had to ask 3 times for napkins and when they were finally brought to the table she acted as if she was doing us a Big Favor. Then after our food was brought to the table and we asked multiple times for eating utensils. The first time we asked her we were polite then asked another server then when we asked at the hostess stand we were told oh we told your waitress to bring them. When she finally brought them to our table she said if you had asked nicely I would have brought them sooner. Can you believe that!!! The floor manager came over and while he apologized also made excuses for her confrontational behavior. 5 stars for food and food prep 0 stars for rude service or lack of service.
