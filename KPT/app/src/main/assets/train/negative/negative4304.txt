I've eaten plenty of less-than-delicious Italian food but fortunately more of the delicious kind whether in the motherland or here at home in the states. While I had high expectations for Lidia's it gets lumped into the former category. I really hate to say this but Olive Garden's dishes have more flavor than those we ordered at Lidia's (and I don't even like OG...). I ordered the pasta trio and all three were oh so bland as was my mother's lasagna bolognese. My S.O. ordered the boar raviolis (I know they weren't called that but I know nothing of porcines as far as food goes) and thought they were just 'meh' and too salty.  The menu was pretty limited and it was especially underwhelming considering the prices of the dishes. I wouldn't return here there are a couple of other restaurants in Pgh that I would rather visit next time i'm in the mood for Italian. Service was good and the atmosphere was pleasant though.
