The best thing about this restaurant is the atmosphere. My husband and I went here during restaurant week & left feeling disappointed. Our waiter was not very attentive. The bread they bring out is good but the bean topping to go with it was overpowered with onions. We both got the seafood salad as an appetizer and it was just ok. Nothing spectacular. We both also had the lamb as an entree. It was cooked perfectly to medium & was very tender but it lacked seasoning. It would have been wonderful with some seasoning. For dessert I had the panna cotta. It was not impressive. The presentation was nice but it had no flavor. My husband had the chocolate cake which tasted like a frozen cake you get from the supermarket. The manager insisted it is made fresh in house but I'm not sure if I believe that. Overall we were very disappointed especially with the good reviews we had read. We will not go back.
