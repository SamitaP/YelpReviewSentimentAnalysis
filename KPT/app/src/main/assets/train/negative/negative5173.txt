Don't waste your time!Oh where should I start..?My family and friends came here for a Sunday lunch. The prices are crazy high (for -cheap- pasta). The menu outside the building and website doesn't match what they show you at the table. One of our guest was the last one to receive his perfectly square cheese ravioli and the filling was still frozen! (You'd think that for a $16 ravioli plate you'd get home made). After they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat. Some had flavorless Chicken Piccata Fish and Eggplant Parmigiana. The atmosphere didn't help. The only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce. I don't understand the big fuzz some make about this restaurant. What a joke!
