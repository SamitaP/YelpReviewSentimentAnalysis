Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you've been doing!  Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger!  A great place to be drunk in not so great to be hung over in...  They have your typical greasy spoon fare so don't go if you're concerned about your health.  Otherwise eat on brave soul eat on!
