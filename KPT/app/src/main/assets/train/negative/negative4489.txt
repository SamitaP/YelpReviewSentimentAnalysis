Had lunch here at the OOH on a cold day in early Spring. It was a Wednesday and thankfully not a Friday in Lent where it would have been much busier.I opted for the dual crabcakes platter with two sides and the crabcake was mushy not fried long enough and just lacking any reasonable portion of crab meat.I've had the fried oysters before and they were pretty good.  I think your results might be highly dependent on what you order.This lunch kinda sucked.
