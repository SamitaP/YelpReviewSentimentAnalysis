OK update time.  Sushi we split was good.  Miso soup had an odd taste this visit.My main course (Butaniku) was unforgettable a real meh!  Not sure what happened this night.  Our waitress was MIA most of the night.  Could not even find her to try to get refills desert or our check.  Must have been an off night for everyone.
