I've been here twice. The first time was at least two years ago and I can't remember anything in particular about it.The second time though was tonight Valentine's Day. A group  of friends and I chose this restaurant after the place we wanted to go was closed--for good. Roland's was it then. It wasn't very crowded so we were seated right away. The first thing that caught my attention was how the waitresses/waiters were dressed. They weren't dressed how I would have expected them to be. They were in jeans and baggy tshirts. But our waitress was helpful and our food came out pretty quickly. it wasn't a memorable meal or experience. I wanted a caesar salad with my dinner but they were out of romaine lettuce (and it wasn't late in the evening--maybe 6:30pm at the latest). The bleu cheese dressing though tasted pretty good. I ordered a ravioli dish for my entree but when I asked if I could get a different sauce the waitress said it's already mixed together meh. I'm not a fan of that. When my friends went to order their pasta dishes they had a choice between penne and linguini but the restaurant was out of penne too.Oh well the prices aren't terrible and the good came out pretty quickly and hot. It's not the best restaurant but it's not a stink hole either.
