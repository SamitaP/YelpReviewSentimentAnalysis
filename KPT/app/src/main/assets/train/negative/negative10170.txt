Visited on Friday 3/25 for supper. I was really looking forward to a good Cajun meal. Out of fish on a Friday????  Are you kididng? And crab soup so salty was not edible. The waitress who was really good did not charge for it after complaining. Rice and beans pretty good and wait staff quite attentive. I really did expect better. Will not be going there again.
