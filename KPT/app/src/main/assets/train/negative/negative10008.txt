I am not an SF snob but I have to agree with the previous two reviews by San Franciscans.  I travel often and am not native here so I also have to say Charlotte doesn't understand good service at all.  Either I am left with an empty glass for way too long or I'm being badgered and made to feel rushed.  At Lavecchia's I've had both experiences.  Both times too I was underwhelmed by the decor and seafood's taste and presentation.  I will not be going back again.  Oh how I wish there was a good seafood restaurant here!
