This place has changed.  Just a couple of years ago you could count on Harris for good food good drinks dependable service and a great atmosphere.  Those days seem like a distant memory now.  My wife and I went for dinner on Sunday (3/11/12).  That was a huge mistake.  The food was just bad.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and coleslaw.  The fries were burnt and cold the slaw was wilted and the sandwich was mediocre at best.  The worst part was that it took 45 minutes to prepare.  If you're going to serve bad food why does it take so long to make it? This was topped off by a waitress who never bothered to stop back to check on our drinks. I was really shocked by how bad everything was there.  I have such fond memories of the place from just a few years ago....  There are too many other nice options in Shady Side to waste one's time at this dump.
