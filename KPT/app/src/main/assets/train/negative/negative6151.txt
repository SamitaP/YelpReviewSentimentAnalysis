I did not have a good experience here tonight. We did not make reservations and got seated within 10 minutes! We were happy about that but.. Waiting for our food took so long! We were ready to walk out and just cancel the order because of the wait.. But ended up waiting it out. The food turned out okay. Miso soup- needed scallions and seaweedSalad- the dressing wasn't gingerly enough and tasted like Italian dressing. - the agedashi tofu was not agedashi tofu.. It was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled Chinese chilli. Ugh.. So disappointed. - sushi was okay. It was just average for me.  They were definitely quick with the check and cleaning at the end! Overall didn't have a good experience and food was salty for my taste. :/
