I live very close so I decided to have a light dinner and drinks before the salsa crowd was wheeled in.  I noprmally google a menu before my visit to have an idea of the cuisine.  I sat at the bar and ordered wine.  (stemless glasses huge turn off but there are trendsetters and everyone else).  The actual menu was the menu online chopped in half. (There were only about 6 items on the actual menu).  I chose the shrimp skewers.  I was literally the only person at the bar outside the staff that consisted of 5 20somethings eating humus and crackers and a 40something with a cheap french press dolling out samples to the others.  I was served the spicy shrimp and offered no water or receptacle for said shrimp's tails.  Bad service!  I was LITERALLY THE ONLY PERSON at the bar.  My wine glass remained empty for at least 10 minutes before my server found a loll in her humus eating gabfest to see if the one customer may need something.  After I finished the second glass I managed to flag down one of the all black outfitted staff who was still eating something with her finger as she went back behind the bar to ask for a check.  I've been to BOSSA NOVA many time before and I understand the short service when a the bar is beyond capacity but again I was the only person at the bar.  There were some people seated at tables but the bar just me.  So if you are looking for wannabe pretensious night club full of party goers that can't remember what going out looks like than you've found it.  If you want good food good music and a fun atmosphere then run over the valet at bossa nova on your way to anywhere else!
