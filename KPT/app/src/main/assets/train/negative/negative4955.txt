I didn't care too much for the atmosphere because most hole in the wall sort of restaurant are authentic & non-Americanized (which is what I'm looking for).  Location of the restaurant was in a run down (kind of Old Pittsburgh style) and parallel parking was a must be aware that you may have to park far and walk to the restaurant if you're not able to get front door service.  Inside I didn't expect much tablecloths were vinyl and chairs with uneven stands.  All I care about was the authenticity of the food & cost for what it's worth.I started my meal with an appetizer of Goi Cuon with shrimp.  I was highly disappointing when disecting what was in it.  There was 1 shrimp cut in half lengthwise mainly bun (rice noodle) for fillers along with a few strands of beansprouts & lettuce to make it look presentable.  I quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in 2 bites.  My main entree was Pho Ha Noi.  It took forever for the food to arrive it was a big bowl.  Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).  Ok I may be young but I wasnt born yesterday I think I know my pho noodle and sorry it wasn't.  Next visit to the 'burgh I think I'll try Pho Minh & see how their PHO compares to Tram's Kitchen.  So HIGHLY disappointed with my Pho experience.
