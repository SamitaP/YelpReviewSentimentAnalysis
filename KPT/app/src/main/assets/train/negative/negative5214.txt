I also left here scratching my head after all of the lofty reviews of the place.  Yes maybe it is a local institution but it is not worthy of one of the highest yelp ratings for a restaurant in Pittsburgh.The burger was mildly admirable.  I'll trust their word that they use high quality ground beef but it's still ground beef not ground sirloin or anything.  It was also huge cumbersome greasy expensive and flavorless.  The amount of blue cheese they gave me for 50c was almost a joke as well.  Wish I would have gotten the steamed broccoli my potato salad was a sea of mayonnaise.Even given my limited experience of the burger options in Pittsburgh I would put double-wide grill's burger above these.Not much for atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong I don't mind dirty dark and dingy if it has character.
