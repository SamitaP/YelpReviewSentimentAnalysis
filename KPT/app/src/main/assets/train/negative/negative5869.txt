Filthy isn't a strong enough term. Try infested.  NEVER EVER AGAIN. No matter how much I adore Bell's Sicilian pizza (which I typically order to carry out) the filth of the place is overwhelming. Took my mother into the dining room Friday evening. We were promptly seated (table nearest the kitchen and the wait station constant employee traffic) and given beverages and menus via the hostess who promised our waitress would take care of us soon. For the next 20 minutes no employee acknowledged our existence although we quickly placed our closed menus at the edge of the table to signal our readiness to order. As the minutes ticked away I tried not to look at the foul carpeting which appears to have been last cleaned approximately never. A cook emerged from the kitchen and quite literally shouted over our heads to a waitress at the far end of the nearly-filled dining room because he couldn't read her writing. (Have these people never eaten in a restaurant themselves??) Even still we waited... until I absently flicked at one of the dozens of dark spots on the wall above our booth. It flew away. INSECTS ALL OVER THE WALL. If that's how the front is maintained what must the kitchen look like??? We reopened the menu found beverage prices and left money on the table. There was no indication that any of the waitresses or the hostess even noticed. DISGUSTING AND INEXCUSABLE. The place needs to be shut down and fumigated. Are they afraid they'd lose money if they closed long enough to CLEAN? Do they pay anyone to clean anything? I'll never go back.
