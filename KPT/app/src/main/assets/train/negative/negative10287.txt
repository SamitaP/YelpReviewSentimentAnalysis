I'd heard great things about Blue especially in the drinks department (I stuck with beer this time though).  I visited on a weeknight and enjoyed the darker upscale ambiance.  However based on previous reviews the food is hit or miss.  My dinner there was a substantial miss for a pretty substantial price. I ordered the mixed green salad and it was nothing special -- the dressing was blah and it was just regular goat cheese -- no crust no heat etc.  I ordered the NY Strip because the waiter said it was amazing as did another member of my group.  Side note: the service was phenomenal no problems in that department.  When it arrived we both found the steak to be EXTREMELY tough.  I know it's not a filet but you're supposed to be able to get your knife through it without breaking a sweat.  I didn't try my friend's steak but he actually sent his back for being virtually inedible.  He swapped out for a filet with blue cheese and was quite pleased that he did.  Maybe I should have done the same....I don't know but if you have to send your food back in order to get a decent meal it's a pretty bad sign especially at an expensive establishment.  In Blue's defense I believe they were pretty upset about my friend's meal -- we basically got an entire desert tray for free.  Those were luckily delicious as they made up a substantial part of my otherwise sub-par meal. Bottom line I will not go here again except for cocktails some appetizers and some jazz.  Or if someone else is picking up the tab.
