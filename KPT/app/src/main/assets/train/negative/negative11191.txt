Wanted to give this place 3 stars but the waitress was weird.  The bill hadn't even arrived and my date offered to pay by handing the waitress her credit card.  Being old-fashioned I wanted to pay for dinner.  The waitress was adamant on charging dinner to whoever was the first person to give a card.  I tried in vain but she refused which was perplexing.  It might get difficult with diners trying to make the waitress take their payment but they have to deal with it.  Feel it out be a little patient if need be.  Part of being a good server is being able to adjust and stuff.Food was average - nothing special.  Three stars because the ambiance is just astounding - live jazz music and restaurant is a house literally.dmo out
