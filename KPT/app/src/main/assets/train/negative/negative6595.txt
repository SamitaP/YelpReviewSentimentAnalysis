I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!We went to Harris Grill for lunch we ordered some entree and calamari for appetizer. It was calamari on top of some salad with Thai chili sauce dressing. Just when we almost finished the calamari I found one entire cigaret in the salad. CIGARET!!!! I have no idea how a cigaret can be in the salad. IT IS JUST DISGUSTING. We left without having the resting of the food.
