SUMMARY:  This was about the 6th time I've dined at Mert's.  First time since joining Yelp.  I was disappointed by the exceptionally long time it took for dinner to be brought to our table and by the terrible version of BBQ they offer.  DETAILS:We were promptly seated and had our drink order taken.  The drinks came right and the appetizer (soul sampler) came out in a very reasonable time.  But it took at least another 20 minutes (maybe even 30) to get our entrees: BBQ with sides and blackened pork chops with sides. And while the sides and chops all got good comments we did NOT like the very molasses-heavy BBQ.  This is nothing like I've ever eaten in North or South Carolina (and I'm a native).  That needs to be revamped or better disclaimed on the menu.Anyway so unlike my previous visits I left very disappointed and unfortunately left my out-of-town friends with a bad impression of what has usually been a good place.
