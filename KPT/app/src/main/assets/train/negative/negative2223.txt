Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd and we tried it one day for lunch. Not really understanding the positive reviews here but to each his/her own. I found the food watery overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes each dish tasted much like the other and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings but I abhor a smelly old carpet and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt both across the street.
