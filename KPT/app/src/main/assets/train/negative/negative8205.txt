I wish the GPS had been right about the derelict building it had initially brought me to....I would have been happily on my way to a satisfying meal elsewhere.....perhaps a place that doesn't have two legal parking places in a 5 block radius ....one of which is occupied by the restaurants mascot. An old beat up pick up truck....which seems to have avoided citation for 20 years.  When this gem was recommended to me as a fantastic seasonal restaurant I wanted to call them immediately and ask them what season we were in that served these nasty cold ..Oh but smokedquesadillas .  or perhaps when a good time of the year it was to enjoy this warm on the outside...cold on the inside tuna melt.  The waitress seemed shocked that one could possibly eat it any other way.    About 2/3 through the meal we were asked to settle up...because at that time of day... Something with their computers demanded them to stop all service... And start a new tab.  Nothing special on this menu.... Overrated pub grub.
