Went here on a Tuesday night w/out reservations in an effort to try something new. Great wine list with both affordable and expensive options. The decor is cool and the atmosphere seemed lively. Great spot for work dinners or events. But the food was just not good especially at the prices they are charging. For $20 small portion of flavorless halibut no side included and halibut was like cardboard. Really boring beef carpacchio and bland herb risotto. I never complain about service but they did not bus surrounding tables for over 30 mins and for a dinner/drinks bill of $100+ it would be nice to not stare at unfinished food for the entire meal.It is very possible we caught this place on an off night but I doubt it. Go for drinks eat elsewhere.
