Some friends and I were here Friday August 22nd. It was very crowded due to Little Italy Days in Bloomfield. I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for a table as it was busy but they seemed understaffed which is unacceptable. Once we were seated we waited 15 minutes for our waitress Misty to greet us and take our drink orders. She complained about how busy they were and how this was the second double in a row she was working. She told us she was thinking of getting wasted that night and coming in the next day hungover... I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25 my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.Two other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check. From the time we walked in to the time we walked out was about 2 hours. Would never consider going back.The food was good.
