First time I went we had a large party of 10 of which 3 were stuck in traffic.  We told them this and they seated us anyway.  We called them knowing they were a few miuntes or better away.  We ordered drinks and food for them.  About 5 minutes later the hostess who sat us came back and started trying to talk us into squeezing into a table for 6.  I told her they were down the street and we had just ordered for them so there was no reason to switch.  She said there was another large party that was all here .... Just then the rest of our group showed up.  If they had not I would have left.  The server and the food that night were great and almost made me forget about the hostess.  Then we came again with some friends raving about the food.  Must have been a new chef.  The service was still great but EVERYTHING was really salted. The pizza the calamari the pasta. 3 of us ordered a home made pasta with portabello mushrooms it was so salty we could not eat it. The waitress tried so hard she apologized and even offered us a free tira misu for desert. Sorry to say cause the servers are great but Mama's is off our list.
