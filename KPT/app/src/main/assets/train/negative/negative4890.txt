I *used* to think Donatelli's was a great place--they're incredibly cheap the premade foods like crab raviolis are delicious and they have awesome chocolate covered pretzels and biscotti.Then I saw one of the deli members drop meat on the floor pick it up and stick it right back in the case! Also a whole tray of meatballs and sauce from the hot bar was spilled all over the floor. They just scooped it right back in and I only hope it wasn't served! The place smells awful and the workers are grumpy. There's a lady there who's always screaming and cursing and some fat guy that's just as bad. The LAST experience I had with Donatelli's was when I bought a tub of freshly packed soynuts. I got home cracked a brew and reached into my beer snack to find a WORM!!! If you value your health as I do do not eat anything from Donatelli's that  was packed there.
