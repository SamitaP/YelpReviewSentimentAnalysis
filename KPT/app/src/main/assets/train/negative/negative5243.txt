Overrated. No seating until all members if party have arrived...so we awkwardly hovered over empty tables.  The second bummer here was the lack of french fries  - which is borderline criminal when you offer a burger.  The bun was dry the burger was ok generous portion of meat though.  Nothing special here.  the crowd here is about as un-diverse as you can get. not sure what all the hype is about.
