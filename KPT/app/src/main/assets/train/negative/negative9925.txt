I was extremely disappointed! I went to Savannah Red back in 2005 for a Valentine's Day dinner. It wasn't awful back then but I have been back until a few weeks ago when my friends wanted to go for Restaurant week. I was surprised at the choice of restaurant - since it is not a popular spot in uptown but went along anyway. It was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time. The waitress hung on our chairs while taking orders she kept making references to getting off of her shift and drinking at the bar and waited 15 to get drinks. After we had ordered we heard a loud crash from the kitchen the waitress said yeah that was your food so it will take a while for some of you. Half of the table recieved their meal while the rest of the table had to watch everyone eat. My girlfriend asked for a rare steak and it came out well-done! When she asked for a new steak the waitress instead of appologizing she said well I guess we will be waiting on 4 plates instead of 3. At the end of the meal the waitress said well I guess you will all want seperate checks - as if she was annoyed. The entire meal was awful and took 3 hours! The waitress also added on 20% gratuity - which really irritated me. I will never go back to Savannah Red.
