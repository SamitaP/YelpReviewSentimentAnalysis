i used to work at this location in high school - back then it was great food and a fun atmosphere. Things have really slipped since then though. They drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese....  I thought it was supposed to be a healthy dish (?)....My sweet tea wasn't sweet at all which was UBER disappointing for me because I hadn't had sweet tea in 8 months because I moved up north...My soup was alright - French Onion - pretty standard. My friend enjoyed his meal though so that was cool. But he wanted to satisfy a sweet tooth after his lunch and the server never suggested desert. He suggested everything else that we ddin't want but I guess he just gave up and figured we wouldn't want it anyway. Nothing great and I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again...
