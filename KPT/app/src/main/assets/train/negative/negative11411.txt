Greasy overpriced food. Mac and cheese boring bland no flavor . Yams were   from the can. Chicken livers were  fried hard in old smelly grease that stank up my whole car.  . Cake dry boring I dont believe it was home made.  . Umimpressed and disappointed  I won't eat here again.  Its  definitely not like momma makes it.
