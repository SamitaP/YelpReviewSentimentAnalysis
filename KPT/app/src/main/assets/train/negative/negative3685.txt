Why come to this place when you have a tasty world of Italian restaurants right at your hungry fingers in this town!The place is essentially a tourist-trap that seeks to reel in folks who are looking for a fun looking italian warehouse (now...how would this be fun? Apparently it is to some.)Don't get me wrong...the food is not atrocious. But it certainly is sub-par. My chicken parm was quite un-tasty and seemed as if the spaghetti had come out of a can. The service was mediocre.Keep driving to Bloomfield!
