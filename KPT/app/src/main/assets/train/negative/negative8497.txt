I just went through the line at the sandwich shop in the courtyard of the Hearst Tower.  The sandwich/ salad makers were polite and fast and the price was reasonable for downtown.  The salad looks like it could be good but there is no way for me to know because they were out of utensils.   How can a place that makes salads to go be out of utensils?  And the worst part is that you don't know it until you already through the line and have paid.  They should let people know before they pay.  The guy at the register made no apology or attempt to find some way to provide something to eat with.  Now sitting at my desk with a salad that I can't eat gotta give it one star for the poor service.
