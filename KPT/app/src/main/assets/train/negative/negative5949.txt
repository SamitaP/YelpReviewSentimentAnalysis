My son and I stopped by China Gate after a movie in the Galleria.  We had eaten there before when it was called Mark Pi's China Gate.  The food was very good.  I think it's changed hands and here's why.  We were seated and given menus.  We placed our order with the waiter and not less than 3 minutes later ALL of our food was brought out.  I was shocked.  There was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast.  My son took one bite I didn't even bother and we called the waiter back over.  I told her I expected fresh food not some hidden buffet that had been sitting out.  I got up to leave and she called the manager who tried to force me to pay.  I refused.  I will never go back.  There is such a thing as food too fast.  If I wanted fast food I'd have gone to Mickey D's.
