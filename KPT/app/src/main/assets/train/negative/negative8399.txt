Went in to meet some friends who'd come in from out of town.  Lovely place admittedly - the restoration after the fire is impressive.  When we arrived the hostess when she finally quit talking on her phone couldn't find our reservation and seemed pretty snotty about it.  We went upstairs found our people and spent the next two hours trying to get the attention of the bartenders to little avail.  The music was too loud for conversation.Summary: VERY noisy terrible service.  I'd tell you about the food but the food we ordered never arrived.  Wild dogs couldn't drag me back.
