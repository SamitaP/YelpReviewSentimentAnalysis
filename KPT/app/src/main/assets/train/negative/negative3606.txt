I was running out of time today at lunch and needed somewhere to grab lunch. On a positive note i seen the Google street view car downtown :)Anyways my gyro just wasnt that good. It seemed smaller than any other gyro in town the fries were just frozen potatoes with no flavor and it just wasn't a very awesome experience.Also almost $9 for a small gyro frozen fries & a small drink is not a deal. M&Ts is $7.50- same fries of course  but a large delicious gyro.  I dunno I've heard great things about this place but i'll stick with my regular oll Zorba's for downtown or M&Ts afterhours.
