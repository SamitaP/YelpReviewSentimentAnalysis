Well as stated in the previous review of their lunch buffet we finally went for dinner and were horribly disappointed to discover a night-and-day comparison between the lunch and dinner. I had gnocchi she had Veal Imperial and we ordered 'traditional style' which meant for an addition $4 it came with marinated mushrooms Clams Casino soup and salad. My friend left 1/3 of her veal dish on her plate and didn't want to take it home. I took a bite and my tongue experienced absolutely no flavor to the extent that I had to take a sip of my iced tea to see if I was getting a cold and losing my sense of taste. I could taste the tea. I could taste absolutely NOTHING from her veal.  With the gnocchi I ordered the sausage which was again $3 extra and when it arrived it was a flat sausage patty cut in half that tasted like a dry sausage McMuffin patty. The salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies. The wedding soup had two tiny meatballs and about 1/3 cup of celery. The meal in general was a total disaster but we ordered dessert anyway and the tiramisu was still partially frozen. Then the bill came to over $82.  We could not believe that we'd enjoyed the lunch buffet so completely which was only $7.95 and that this dinner as overpriced as it already was was so completely void of flavor and character. It's baffling to comprehend that an Italian restaurant that's been around as long as they have would still survive with these prices and total lack of quality for dinner. We had gone in with such high hopes.  But honestly for dinner it was such a huge let-down we'll never go back. We'll go to the lunch buffet but never to dinner. It was truly truly just plain sad.
