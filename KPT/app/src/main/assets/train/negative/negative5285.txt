This was my first and last time at this restaurant. I thought Tessaro's was some sort of Pittsburgh landmark and I've heard rave reviews of their burgers. The burger I got was undercooked. I ordered it well done and it was definitely pink in the middle. But I didn't send it back because I never send anything back. I just ate it and it was a sloppy greasy mess. The bread was cheap and tasteless. The home fries were just diced potatoes. That burger sat clogged in my stomach for 3 or 4 hours. And I had to make a few runs to the bathroom because I thought I was going to make a mess in my pants. Burger king is a lot better than this place and at a fraction of the cost. What else you got Pittsburgh? This better not be the best you got.
