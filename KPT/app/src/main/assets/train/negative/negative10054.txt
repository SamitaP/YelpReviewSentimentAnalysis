A lot of people (girls) I know love this place but to me it seems like much of the same in Uptown Charlotte: it's crowded loud and a little over-the-top. Again though as I've always said: this isn't always a bad thing. On Thursdays through Sundays this place is pretty packed with twenty-somethings and maybe braver older adults looking to booze and get after it probably before hitting a louder/dancier place nearby. There are plenty of food options (try their mini pizzas and other appetizers) so you can come here and grab a snick whilst you drink or before you head out to drink more. I've been told that their martinis (their selection and creativity is extensive) are awesome so if you're into that you may wanna try them. And they usually have some great deals on those so be sure to check that out.
