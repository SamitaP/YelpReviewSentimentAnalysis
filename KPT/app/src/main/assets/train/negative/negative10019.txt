I should know better than to eat seafood in a restaurant that is land locked. My friend and I decided to take advantage of a Groupon that i had purchased and roll it into a date night. He had never been and what better way to try out a new restaurant. Our server was really nice and touted that they're known for their seafood so of course I think okay let's order seafood. Started off with raw oysters not bad I'm learning to like them and they had all the right sauces no rogue shell pieces. Tasty. I had the stuffed shrimp he had the almond crusted tilapia. The stuffed shrimp was way too salty and a little fishy. i think the shrimp was old or wasn't cleaned well. My mashed potatoes would have been great if they weren't so salty and the bacon that was supposedly there i could find. The tilapia was a complete opposite! no salt at all!. It was cooked fine but needed some seasoning. Definitely their dishes were inconsistent. I have another groupon so i will try again but i think the decision was to just order the steak and pasta instead. Being a San Francisco resident i know i can't expect the seafood to compare but i would have hoped that being in downtown Charlotte they would step it up a bit.....and almost forgot because they did i had an open table reservation for points that they cancelled.  Now i'm unable to get the points on my reservation.  so unfortunate.
