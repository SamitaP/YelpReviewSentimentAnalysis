They have inaccurate hours posted. I tried to order at 11:30 pm when yelp says they close at 2am and they were already closed. When I told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said oh that's ok.... And hung up on me. I will never be ordering from them again which is a shame since they are so close to me. I immediately called Pizza Parma which gladly delivered to me. I recommend ordering from Pizza Parma since they have similar menu items they post accurate hours and they don't hang up on you! Seriously? Why answer the phone?
