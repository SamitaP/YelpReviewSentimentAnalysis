I was looking for a new sushi spot but was somewhat disappointed with the experience. First I was the only customer during my entire dining experience..which somewhat scares me. I was seated and served a complimentary salad. The salad was good but overdressed..crazy overdressed. I ordered the onion soup and egg rolls. The onion soup was basically broth with a few onions but no real onion flavor which is what I was hoping for. As for the egg rolls can I say frozen.Onto the sushi. I chose a roll based on the waitresses recommendation however it had a mango sauce that was so overwhelming I sent it back. I was not offered anything else and was charged for the roll $13.95 after eating only two pieces. I questioned the server about being charged and she expressed the fact she told me what I was getting and I ordered it. Whoa was I surprised. I expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do. She disappeared and came out with an older women. Upon returning to my table she did remove the roll but was very unpleasant about it. Although I appreciate the fact they removed the roll but was not impressed otherwise and will stick to my other favorites.
