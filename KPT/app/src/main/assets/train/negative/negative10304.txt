Very curteous service but could not make up for a compltely lackluster dinner. Ordered the rib eye special with herbed gnocci and broccoli rabe. Steak was bland gnocci was dry and lacked any flavor while broccoli rabe was over salted. Sticky toffee pudding for dessert was too sweet. This was my third and last meal there - three strikes and you are OUT! This CA girl knows better.
