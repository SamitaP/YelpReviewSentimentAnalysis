My bosses used to drag me here for business get-togethers and meetings.I know it's hard to imagine hating a place where someone else has picked up the tab. But consistently once the waiters figure out who's paying if it's not you forget it.But I guess what the Aquavina staff can't figure out is if they treat you badly when you're not paying you won't return when it's your turn to pick up the tab. And I've had such consistently mediocre to bad service here that will never happen.I once waited an hour for a drink and chips that never came surrounded by a dozen people eating and drinking. What a lovely time. That same night asking the greeter at the door to help find my party drew nothing but a blank stare and I had to wander the place looking for them.It's not always THAT bad but it's never met expectations.For the record: I've had lunch and attended social get-togethers there. It's been about two years since I've been there. The very last time I went service was tolerable.
