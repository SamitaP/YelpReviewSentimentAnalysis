I've been to Tram's several times always hoping for a better experience and more importantly better food.  I eventually gave up.  The food tends to be bland the owner brusque and with Pho Minh just up the street I find myself going there when I'm craving a hot bowl of pho on a cold Pittsburgh winter night.Food highlights -    None that I can really think of.  The food is cheap.Food cons -    The component that makes or breaks a bowl of pho is the broth.  It is the one thing that must be good for the soup to be enjoyable.  I've never had any hint of real flavor from the broth itself (before you add the plum sauce and the srirachia and basil and lime).  This is something that Tram's has gotten badly wrong every time I visited.
