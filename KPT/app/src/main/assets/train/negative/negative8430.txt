Ri Ra is one of the coolest bars in Charlotte from a decor/ambiance perspective. After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be. What I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment. Stick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner.
