When me and my boyfriend came in we noticed that the interior design was nicely decorated. As we were being sat we noticed the table was literally five inches away from the table next to us. Not enough room for me and my boyfriend to leave if we have to go to the bathroom. We could not hear ourselves talk because of the conversation going on 5 inches from us. next The buffet food selection was only eight to nine different things. The food was okay but lacked the spices and taste. The reason its not a one star is because of the excellent service we had gotten. The food was warm and nothing was heating it. We would not go back!
