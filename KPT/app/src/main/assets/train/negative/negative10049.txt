Dropped into Cosmos last night for dinner before the Michael Buble concert.  It was a nightmare.  First and foremost they were serving a limited special event menu.  Not a huge deal except the concept of a limited menu is to reduce the variety of entrees being prepped so you can get meals out of the kitchen faster when the place is packed.  Four diners at my table and all three entrees and my salad (more on that shortly) arrived at different times with the last one arriving 10 minutes after the first.  And brought to the table without apology.  So why did I order a salad?  Becuase I wanted an entree with chicken as the protein and there was not a single chicken entree on the limited menu (I am not counting the chicken and shrimp jambalaya).  I also didn't appreciate that they served olives with the pits in a salad...a recipe for cracked or chipped dental work.  Lastly our waiter forgot our drinks and bread after several requests  and then messed up our bills (yes we split checks...shame on us).  If you are going to go through the trouble of doing a special event menu to accomodate a crowd then round out the preparations by staffing appropriately (in the kitchen and the dining room).
