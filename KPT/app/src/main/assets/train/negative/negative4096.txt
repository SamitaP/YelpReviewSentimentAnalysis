Yuck I have avoided this Subway like the plague. It's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  I literally walk past this Subway 5 times a week.  Even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. When I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. The attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. As some one who eats at Subway 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion avoid this subway.
