This place was just OK for me.  I was pretty disappointed with the fried chicken because I felt it could have been more flavorful and more fried.  I was surprised because I would have expected more. The catfish my dad and sister ordered was way more fried than the chicken my mom and me had ordered. Also don't expect the fish to be a fillet. It's a whole fish.Even though our server was very friendly I was also very disappointed with him. It was rare that he came by to check on us and he had also forgotten to give us the corn bread. When he wasn't there to check on us we resorted to asking a different waitress that walked by for boxes and the check. However she didn't bother probably because we weren't her table. Rudeness...Overall experience could have been better but at least we tried it.
