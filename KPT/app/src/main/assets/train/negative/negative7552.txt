This business has been here for several years and how its survived I'll never know. The kids that are employed here must get paid next to nothing cause every time I get up the nerve to try them again its a whole new crew. Each seems to sass and ignore the customers worse than the last crew did. The wings are good and I guess its just the fact that there's no competition that they make enough to stay open. This place would kill if the staff just PRETENDED to care about customers. Example: Last time I ordered wings I knew they would take FOREVER so I didn't even leave my house for a while. Then when I got there I was waiting and wanted to pay my bill so I could leave when they got ready. Couldn't do THAT!!!! Had to finish cooking them to release the ticket so she could ring it up. So they must have waited to start them until I got there 'cause it was well over ten minutes later when they finally came to the front. (WTF? WHY CALL AHEAD?????) Then she was busy helping other people that must not have been able to read a menu or understand english and it took several minutes more for her to get my money so I COULD FINALLY GET MY CARCASS OUT OF THAT PLACE!!!. EVERY time I've been in this place must be a dozen by now its been some sort of Don't give a flying +++ attitude that just insults me to the point I don't want to come back. Presently I have a STRONG hankering for some of their wings but it just hasn't been long enough that I'm willing to go back.
