On Friday night the office I work for had our Christmas Party at Mama Ricotta's. It was a great time it has a great atmosphere but the food was sub par. I think we ordered every appetizer on the menu.Calamari - It was ok I am not much of a fan it did seem a bit on the rubbery side. Bruschetta - Was very soggy with the tomatoes not sure if that was the point but soggy bread is not very appetizing. Tomatoes with mozzarella - The tomatoes were great but the mozzarella slices were SO thick it was ridiculous nearly double the size of the tomatoes. Goat Cheese - This was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night. Very rich and smooth. I ended up ordering the special of the evening: Chicken and spinach ravioli with white truffle oil. It was good but nothing to rave about. I have had way better Italian in Charlotte so its hard for me to recommend Ricotta's.Oh and I dont know if it was me but the floor seemed super slippery!
