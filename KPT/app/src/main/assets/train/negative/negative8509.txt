Just average unfortunately.  The good:  My drink...dark and stormy is going to be my new standby.  The mediocre:  Everything else.Burger was just so so as were the fries.  The burger was the 704...I honestly can't remember if It even came w/ the pickle chips.  The really really low point of the meal was the desert. The bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock. It did come smothered with a caramel sauce but that couldn't save it.  When asked how our food was I was honest and could tell the waiter was taken aback. I mean seriously don't ask me if you don't wanna know.  I was polite about it but said that the dessert was just average.  And questioned why it was cold.  Bread pudding is always warm no?  He also got docked a few points for twice trying to take my plate while I still had more then half of my food left.  He actually removed my girlfriend's drink while she was still working on it!  It was nice to have a late night eating option in uptown but unless someone else wants to go I won't be back.
