The atmosphere of Maharani is nice. Quiet with modern decor and Indian artwork.The service is good; the staff always keeping an eye on our water levels.The food was disappointing; not just my dish but my three friends' as well. We got an array of vegetarian chicken and lamb dishes and everyone left with a very meh opinion. The spices weren't as distinct as most Indian places the quality of the vegetables and meat were subpar and the authenticity of the flavors fell short. I ate the small amount of Gobhi Manchurian I scooped onto my plate and then just chose to not finish it because it was so terrible (and for $12 I usually don't do that).I'd adventure elsewhere to Indian if I were you.
