What the hell Phil's Tavern? Every time I come here (usually before a show) things just don't work out. I wanted them to but they just didn't.FOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed but I was hungry. DRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The dirty martini was weak and the tiny shrivelled Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a warm Corona? Do not want.SERVICE: Nice but few and far between.ATMOSPHERE: Dank dirty sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.Overall: Don't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area I just need to find them.
