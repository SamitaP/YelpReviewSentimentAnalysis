This place used to be my favorite spot for 3 years until last night. I took my mom out for her birthday and we left disappointed. We both have ordered the same 2 meals every time we come shrimp picatta and braised short ribs in red wine sauce. First thing I noticed was the short ribs were no longer on the menu no big deal went to my next favorite dish the shrimp picatta. When the dish arrived I immediatly noticed something was off the color (used to be dark red this was pinkish) the texture (used to be corse now smooth) of the dish looked different and the serving size (could never finish and would take half home). On top of that there were no roasted red peppers and the crispy pancetta used to be thinly sliced crispy pieces mixed in the polenta the pancetta was chopped and just thrown on top. Then there were capers which I never recalled before and made the dish extremely salty. We complained and the manager came over we told her we get the same dish over and over again and this time it was completely different. She apologized and was very polite but explained they rehired a previous chef and was not aware of the dish being any different since she is still new at her job. I don't know why this chef would completely change the perfected dish. I don't know what else this chef has changed but according to the atmosphere people clearly notice a difference. I've never seen the place so empty
