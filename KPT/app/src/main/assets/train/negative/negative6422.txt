Date & Time of Visit:  May 21 DinnertimeI don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar eight-course tasting menu.  That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste after the first two (2) courses were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.  Moreover the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants.  As for their restroom only one and a unisex one at that.  And yes there was urine on the floor.
