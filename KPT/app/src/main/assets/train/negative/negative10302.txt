Very RUDE management- we had to wait over an HOUR to get our car out of valet while we watched people leave left and right...we mentioned this to several people - we were offered many excuses to find out in the end that they completely misplaced our CAR! I would have been satisfied if they had offered us a drink- our table spent over $200 on our dinner- we didn't even get an apology...I wrote a letter and everything!The waitstaff was friendly- the meal was ok - nothing special considering Charlotte has plenty of great restaurants . Restaurants have a lot to do with relationships- and they killed mine with this one.  Bottom line the food wasn't THAT good to warrant my return...
