I can't comment on the food (you'll read why) but the process of ordering online is horrible.  We placed an order online knowing there could be up to 60min delivery time and once I called 90 minutes later they said they didn't receive the order.  I got the confirmation email clearly stating our order time it was placed house address etc.The lady on the phone at first was very helpful and say we wouldn't need to pay.  I reread the order to her and after reciting the order she asked How would you like to pay for this? and followed up with Why wouldn't you pay for this?Nice knowin' ya Fortune Cookie Chinese Restaurant......see ya never.
