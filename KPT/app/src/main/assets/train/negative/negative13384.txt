The Thai carved wood and overall decor is amazing- and the service was fine. Sorry to disagree with others but my wife and I found the food to be quite ordinary and well-below quality at other Thai restaurants we visit. The fried spring rolls were greasy- possibly were just fried a second time to get them hot. The Mee Krob was a good appetizer except the lettuce was partially wilted and brown in spots. I usually love pad thai but what was served had soggy noodles and not a lot of taste. Perhaps the main chef was not working on the weekday night I was there. Not likely to try again though.
