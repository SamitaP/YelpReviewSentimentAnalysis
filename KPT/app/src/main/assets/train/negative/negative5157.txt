It is definitely an experience. Located in not such a great part of town. Very old. Food is just ok grease upon grease. Everything came out from the kitchen hot but looked like it was all cooked in the same grease in the same pan. Waitresses do not make much of an effort. She was more concerned with eating her meal.  Cashier was a breath of fresh air. She was chatty and nice.
