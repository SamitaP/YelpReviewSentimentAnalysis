Soul food is ok...needs more seaoning and to be drained of grease. My entire rating is based off the customer service which was very rude and disrespectful for me as a customer. The wait was long and don't try to make reservations because they dont take on weekends.  The waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering. ...imma take yall drink order and food order at the same time so who first? (Her exact words). I live in charlotte and have been here prior to this visit but will never return again. This was by far the worst soul food experience.
