I like the food and the whole fondue experience of the Melting Pot but I give this place only 2 stars because on my last 2 visits I had experienced terrible service.  When I go to a restaurant planning to spend a minimum of $30 per person (excluding drinks) I expect a better level of service than I have gotten here from hostesses and wait-staff.
