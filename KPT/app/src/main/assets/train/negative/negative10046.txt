Just nothing to write home about. I knew we were in trouble when we asked the waiter where the oysters were from and his response was  somewhere up north I think. The fried oyster rockerfeller were very good. We were pretty much the only ones in there. I might stop back for a drink and an app but I would look elsewhere first.
