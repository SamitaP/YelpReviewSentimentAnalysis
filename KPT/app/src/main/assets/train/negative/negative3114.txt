Everyone knows that that if you go to Pittsburgh you go to Primanti Bros. (My friends and I were in town for a Pirates/Phillies game and the PNC Park Primanti Bros was packed the entire game.) We visited the Market Square location and if you eat on the patio it's a fun place to hang out and drink some Iron City beers.  I got the Black Angus Sandwich. It was quite large cut in half and brought on a piece of wax paper. As it turned out I'm pretty sure the wax paper would have tasted better. It was really really not good. I did eat the first half but the bread was so tasteless I thought maybe it would be better if I ate the other half piece by piece. The coleslaw was OK but the french fries were awful and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw and were treated really rudely. Because you know people being rude is hilarious. So I guess if you want an authentic Pittsburgh experience then go here. But if you want actual decent food avoid at all costs
