Don't waste your money!!! When I moved to Brookline about 8 years ago I thought this was a pretty decent restaurant. We always went for wing night and the wings were very large and quite tasty. My favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno. While the wings were decent and cheap for the size I had from day one thought the beers were a bit overpriced for the type of bar and location.  The wings kept me coming back and they were cheap so I didn't mind paying a little bit more for a few beers. As time went on the menu seemed to go through a few changes...a few less items and higher prices and severely decreased portion sizes. I understand that as with anything prices are always going to go up but at the same time the quality should remain the same or get better! This was not the case here after giving them a few tries I gave up. On my last few visits the food was absolutely awful the portions were minuscule and overall overpriced. They also did away with the 50 cent wing night. It always seemed that all the owner was concerned with was the almighty dollar. I tried the the corned beef sandwich just after St. Patty's day last year and the corned beef was almost all fat it was so bad that they took the sandwich and had me order a new item from the menu. After that I tried the fish and chips around lent and what a joke it was! You got potato chips ( not home made) and a few tiny pieces of fish that were almost all breading. All of the specials that they have whether they are food or drink are not worth the prices that this place seems to think that they are. All of their special prices are what most other places have as their regular everyday prices! Definitely stay away and give your money to a local establishment that is more deserving of your money!
