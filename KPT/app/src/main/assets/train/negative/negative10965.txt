I really really want to like Showmars because it's local but it's just kind of icky in the environment. It was probably a unique spot before they spread all over the area but now that Charlotte is super-saturated it's just not that interesting. The french fries are ok I guess. The veggie pita is no good...clearly designed by someone who has never eaten food without meat on it. Maybe I was disappointed because I had high expectations and maybe it's an alright place for the meat-eaters...but it's just not good for me. I haven't had a good experience and I've been to a few locations. I won't be going back.
