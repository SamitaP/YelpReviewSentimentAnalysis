According to the Pittsburgh Magazine this is supposedly one of the best 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh. Clearly they have never been out of their city county or state. I suggest they take a trip to Philly and try some of the good Japanese food. Regardless the snapper/fluke/yellowtail yuzu jalape√±o is a nice touch but not a must try. Service is sketchy here at best.
