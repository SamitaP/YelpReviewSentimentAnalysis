OK first they had lunch specials posted at we walked in which it did state it was lunch until server stated.  The server took the order quick but the entrees too a while I had smothered chicken...yummy NOT instead of pepper jack cheese they replaced it with American cheese white and yellow not melted my guest had BLT soup without the B bacon they replaced the bowl with bacon this time and added a stalk of greenry...hummmm.  The chef salad was a presto creation...a mound of meat and cheese that didn't look nice at all.  I was till trying to figure out why service took so long it was on a few I see why the couple outside turned around when they looked in I wish I had.  Also if you are using a groupon etc.  they remove the tax and tip (18%)  from the total gift check which you pay them separate from the check and you cant order the three course meal which is $20 per person.  Visit at your own risk next time I will only do the bar and apps but the HOT TEA was good
