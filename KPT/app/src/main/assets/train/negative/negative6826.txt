We were disappointed. A client recommended Girasole to us on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. While the food was alright (not spectacular) our waitress was the worst and for some reason on the warmest day of summer the a/c was not on. Everyone in our party was schvitzing and trying hard not to ask our waitress to drop the attitude.  The food was fine but again when the rest of the experience is poor it really doesn't matter how good the food is. We won't be back.
