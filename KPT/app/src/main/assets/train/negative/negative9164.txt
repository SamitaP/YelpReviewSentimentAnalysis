What a disappointment!  My first day in Charlotte and I had checked Yelp reviews to plan my meals.  The only good thing I can say is service was friendly and the cornbread was good.  However that wasn't enough to even warrant a second star because the rest of my food was so unpleasant.  I started with the soul rolls but thought the mixture of flavors and textures did not harmonize well.  It seemed to be a fried app just for the sake of being fried.  But without the pleasing crunch I expected.But the real let down was my shrimp and grits.  What they served me was a bowl of lumpy grits (one particular lump was too big for my spoon to handle) swimming in a truly awful brown mess.  The color made me think the sauce might be rich but it was the opposite.  I could probably recreate the flavor with water thickener and food color - that is just how tasteless it was.  The shrimp had a strange texture that made me think it came from a can.  Then someone had chopped raw green onion and stirred it in.  That was it.  No seasoning.  No flavor.
