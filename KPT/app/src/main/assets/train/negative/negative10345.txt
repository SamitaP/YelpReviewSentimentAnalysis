We were excited to dine at Blue as part of Restaurant Week.  The restaurant is visually stunning creating a wonderful ambiance for dining.... Unless you are seated at the back corner of the adjacent back room staring at a utility door.  Nobody puts Baby in the corner!  I should have spoken up and asked for a new table (there seemed to be plenty even though it was Restaurant Week) but we had already ordered drinks by the time we realized just how bad our table was.The food was very good if not a little heavy.  I had the risotto balls appetizer and the hangar steak.  The hangar steak while flavorful on the inside had a layer of char on the exterior.  I couldn't get the taste of char out of my mouth.  My wife opted for the swordfish which was light flavorful and excellent.  Our server was decent and provided good recommendations for dessert.  However we had trouble finding her when we trying to ask for the check.  Upon leaving I was surprised to see that there was live jazz - something I couldn't see or hear because we were stuck in the CORNER.Was the food good?  For the most part - yes.  Would I go back? Um probably not.
