I used to love Panera but as the years have gone by their standards of both food and service has declined greatly. It's a gamble if you are going to get good food and service or if the D team is working that day and they serve cold soup and sandwiches that look like Stevie Wonder  made them. I have to be deserate now to go there like travelling on the Ohio turnpike and my other rest stop options are burger king and popeyes. Coprorate needs to improve and manage  their quality controltraining and processes. It's like they came out with a bang and now are just coasting.
