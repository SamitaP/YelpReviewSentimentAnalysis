Now I love red lobster but this particular location pissssssed me off!!! It was packed as usual so the food took extra long. the waitress screwed up my bill at the end of the meal when they seated us it looked like the booth had not been properly cleaned and the bathroom was just the nastiest bathroom in America. Like i said i understand it was busy but that is no excuse for how gross the bathroom was. i almost threw up from the smell and you could just tell that it probably had not been cleaned all day. I believe when you are an establishment with meals over $10 your bathroom should be spotless. This is something you would expect from burger king or somewhere not red lobster. I know red lobster is not a 5 star restaurant but come on.
