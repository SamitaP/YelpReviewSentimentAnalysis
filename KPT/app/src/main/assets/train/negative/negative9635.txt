I think I might have been the first person to go to Phil's for a bite to eat.  Ever.  Definitely more a bar - though the business name here is tavern they have a sign that says deli.  I'm not sure I'd call them a deli.  Not by a long shot.  They have food and they even have subs but a deli?  I don't think so.  You go to a deli and you expect a fat greasy guy named Tony to slice some meat and slap it on a roll.  Not some coed to take all your money.Nonetheless we were there hanging out - with the kids actually - after I gave blood prior to the Zombie Walk.  Decided to get a bite since we picked up a discount due to the blood drive.  There is a tiny little area for dining if you don't want the total bar vibe.  And when I say tiny I mean tiny.  I think it was one table.The rest of the place is really a bar.  Or tavern if you want to feel more upscale.Service wasn't too hot.  Or maybe it was hot if you're into that scene.  But it wasn't very good.  They were nice enough and all but they were definitely not into serving a family of four food - they were wanting to get back to the bar (tavern sorry) side and generate some better tips.Despite a proclamation on the menu that they had been rated uptown's best burgers I wasn't all that impressed.  Maybe I'm burgered out.  It wasn't bad but like many places they let it cook too long.  Some of the rest of the family enjoyed it but ultimately we decided that they liked the grease not the juice (and there is a difference!).  The meat itself was dry - anyone can get greasy burgers.  It's more of a challenge to make it tasty and juicy.Sweet Tea Report: Blech.  Possibly the worst in town.  I have had unsweetened tea at places that was sweeter than this stuff.  I will drink most anything in front of me and I didn't even finish half a glass.  Bottom of the barrel.
