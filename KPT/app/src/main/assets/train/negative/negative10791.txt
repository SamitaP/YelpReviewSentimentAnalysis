Won't be back. I will preface my review by saying that I am a stickler for adequate customer service. That said I have patronized this business at least 5 times with consistent experiences. The food is decent Indian food at a convenient location. The customer service however has been lacking each and every time. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was my entrance to the establishment today. As I approached the door there was a server standing there who clearly saw me coming in. Instead of opening the door or at the very least remaining to greet me he turned and walked away. Once I entered there was no warm welcome (which I should not have expected given previous visits) but instead I was rushed through to determine if I would stay for the buffet or if I was there to pick up takeout. I won't belabor the point I will just reiterate that this was my last time spending money in a restaurant that does not appreciate my business. Their customer service is seriously lacking and the food is good at best but certainly nothing special.
