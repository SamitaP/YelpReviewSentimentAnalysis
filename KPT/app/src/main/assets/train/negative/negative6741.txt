This is a neighborhood Denny's with a bar. Small place and the meal was served on plastic plates and they used plastic mugs for coffee. At best less than mediocre breakfast. Pamela's was closed and we were really hungry. Service was slow but they were nice about it. I don't plan to return and would choose an alternative.
