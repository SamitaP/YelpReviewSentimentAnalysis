:( If I could give this restaurant a zero I would. We were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table. My father and father-in-law were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert! I've never been so humiliated. Do NOT go to this restaurant!Their food was mediocre at best. If you want excellent Italian in a small intimate restaurant go to Dish on the South Side. I will not be going back.
