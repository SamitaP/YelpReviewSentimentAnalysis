So I ordered Cherry House because it is the only Chinese place that delivers to my apartment complex and my boyfriend insisted we eat Chinese food for the opening ceremonies of the Olympics.  Yep he's a big dork.  I couldn't decide what I wanted so I went with my standard veggie lo mein while the bf ventured out and had the Cherry Special Chicken.  We also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon.Well the lo mein first of all was not lo mein at all.  It was actually chow mein and that did not really work for me since I prefer the wide flat noodle usually found in lo mein dishes.  It was fairly bland and the veggies were scarce.   I mean c'mon it's veggie lo mein!  Give me something here!  The crab rangoon filling was nothing short of disgusting....it tasted like either ricotta cheese or curdled mealy cream cheese.  Yuck!The Cherry Special Chicken however was pretty darn tasty.  I ended up sharing with the bf because his food was way better than mine.  The sauce was a sweet/spicy combo and the chicken was tender and perfectly fried (i.e. not too greasy).  The only downside:  the cherries were of the marischino variety and tasted just like what you would expect: like they came from the bottom of a Shirley Temple.  Overly sweet and not so appetizing.  A mixed review all in all.....maybe if I branched out and tried something different but I think next time I will just go pick it up from somewhere else.
