I am 8.5 months pregnant and ordered green curry for take out from here. When I placed the order I emphasized I wanted MILD curry since spicy food has given me horrible heartburn during pregnancy. But when I got the food home the curry was so spicy I could not take more than two bites. Secondly it was not that great. It was mediocre curry at best. So goodbye $13 curry. Thanks for making the food too spicy for me to eat.  What the heck!?
