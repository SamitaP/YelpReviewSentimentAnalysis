On a unseasonably warm February evening hubs and I ventured out for some eats. Since we both had fairly light lunches we were starvin' marvins. After attempting to stop by a handful of places (closed on Monday or an hour long wait) we settled on Snoop's hopin' for a hot and fresh burger. Inside Snoop's leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not a dull knife in the drawer and it took me a little while to figure out the um theme of the burger joint. Snoop's...as in detectives...snooping...i saw a Bond poster too. Ok sure...I didn't really care about the overall ambiance as long as the food was solid. And how about the food? Well it's pricier than other old school grilles - to the tune of $15+ for two 1/3 lb. burger combos and a corn dog. This wouldn't really bother me much if the food was better. The burger was fine - passable but very well done (as in quite brown) and essentially flavorless. Onion rings were clunk-ily breaded and with little flavor and fries were meh overall. I was looking for the salty little slivers of love with some crisp! Service wasn't super inviting and the cash register attendant didn't even hint at a smile when we ordered. As soon as cash was in hand she went back to her computer - adjacent to the counter. With a sanitation score barely above 90 and the flavorless eats I have indeed experienced some better burger joints in the QC.
