This place is something STRAIGHT out of a David Lynch film. It felt like I was transported to some sort of alternate reality with the help of a smiling and overbearing greek man outside a restaurant door preying on the weak and indecisive. Something in the air of this place comes off as so fundamentally strange and almost discomforting and nightmare-like. You are going to feel uneasy is what I'm trying to say. - They overcharged us probably intentionally. They don't have itemized receipts. - The waiter kept giving us options as if they were... free options that you're supposed to choose. We caught on when we specifically asked if they cost extra.- The elusive bathroom felt like we were descending down the staircase to hell. Better than nothing I suppose.- The food.... oh my god. None of our food was good. In fact most of it was outright gross/uneatable. The hummus was decent but... I can also get decent hummus at Trader Joe's. We initially felt bad for these guys. A struggling business is always sad to see. But with all of the strange behavior attempts to scam us etc. that sympathy turned into a sense of understanding as to why this place isn't doing so well. If the owners are reading this-- I'm sorry if my review came off harsh.. but really please rethink the way you are going about your business. I don't want you to fail I want you to overcome this. Do it the right way not the scummy way. I know you're trying but try differently.
