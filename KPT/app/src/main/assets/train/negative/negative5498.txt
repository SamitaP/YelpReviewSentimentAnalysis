My husband and I visited on a quiet Friday afternoon and we were politely greeted by the bartender. We each ordered a beer and were promptly served. After taking a moment to glance over the menu we decided on the pita pizza app the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. The pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto tomatoes chicken and cheese. BORING. This appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. Entree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as wet and the Mac and cheese as play-doh. They also served the dish with lettuce tomato and onion as if it were a sandwich. Entree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok so they weren't bad but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce the tacos were again on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. These only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalape√±o peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot.The service was quite friendly so no fault there. The chef however needs a bit of training.
