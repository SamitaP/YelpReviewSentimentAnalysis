Hadn't been here in a few years and remembered I enjoyed it in undergrad especially for late night half off. Called in advance to make sure they were open until 10 and had half off like they used to. The woman who answered the phone said yes to both so I rushed over. The portions were small but I assumed it was because it was half price so I shrugged it off. The tomato sauce was chunky and generic the raita side dish was 4 spoonfuls big and the chutney dips were cold and bland. Assuming this was due to the discount I didn't complain. Receive my check to find out it was all full price. Despite the woman telling me on the phone that it was half off it was buy one get one half off. The woman on the phone was the same as the hostess. She admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake. I don't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous. A subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing. Never going back despite the fond memories I had accumulated when in school. Completely ridiculous.
