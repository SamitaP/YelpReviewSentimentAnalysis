Astonished!  Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs Good pies~ but this time they made a mistake and wrote down pick up.  Hour later I called got brash woman (owner!) Who told me it was my mistake~  I asked if they would deliver but hoped for a fresh pie~  whoa  - absolutely not!  When I asked how we could compromise  she said she was deleting the order. Well ok I guess.I even called back to speak with manager (that's how I figured out she was owner)  and she absolutely didn't care about my 8 yrs of loyalty.Sad for them she probably wonders why her little junky restaurant is not very successful~  and I'll tell a hundred Mt holly people about it because communities don't support business owners who do this ~ all of this over a 12 dollar pizza pretty pathetic huh?Kelly.
