it was ok the actual food was pretty good. the naan was nice the seasoning on both of our dishes was very savory however be warned medium is very very mild that was our fault not there's.  My problem laid with the service and staff the ambiance and the loud music.  The staff was grumpy the music was loud bollywood which i think was only on for the staff and yah i just dont know.  I think as a takeout it would be ok.   it is probably actually a 2.5 but more of a two reaching for a three than a three sliding.    food itself was probably a 3.5
