I have been in Charlotte for over three years and had never been to Cajun Queen but I have been listening to Jazz a lot lately and got in the mood for some live Jazz. From what I have been able to find this is the only place in Charlotte that even has live Jazz so I booked a reservation (through OpenTable) for my girlfriend and I on a Saturday night.No problems with the reservation or getting us seated as soon as we got there but I was immediately disappointed to find out that the music was only upstairs and there would be a 20-30 minute wait for seating upstairs. We were seated downstairs right next to the entrance--it's not great seeing everyone come and go as well as the staff milling about the hostess stand.Our dinner started with no live Jazz (from downstairs it sounded like pots/pans being banged together) and less than ideal seating. Then came the food. It wasn't awful but it wasn't anything special. Certainly not good enough to warrant all of the rave reviews here or the prices they charge. It was seasoned but still tasted very bland to me especially the crawfish which I thought was overcooked. The seasoning certainly did not taste Cajun to me. (I got the crawfish Creole and my girlfriend had the chicken Etouffee.)I was definitely not pleased with my first--and last--experience at Cajun Queen and left $60 poorer and hungry for better food although I was full. Given that Live Jazz 7 nights a week is prominently touted on their website header they really need to specify that it is only upstairs. I would have requested upstairs seating when I made the reservation if I had known that was the only place to hear the music. Either that or they need to remodel that old bland house to open it up more.Bottom line: I will not be going back.
