I was looking forward to dining at the Cajun Queen from hearing about their authentic New Orleans cuisine to seeing their Best Cajun Restaurant in Charlotte status. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't memorable. I wish I could write about the service or the exact taste of the food but it was simply meh. I got the Blackened Catfish Filet with mashed taters (which I do remember and were fabulous) but I think they forgot the blackening on it or don't know what blackening means. I had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick.It's a charming place however they had some live music which I personally found loud (and this moment right here is when I turned old).If you're looking for authentic New Orleans style food like I was I would pass.
