GROSS!!! Many people told me to go here and I was totally disappointed! It was bland the coleslaw was too tangy (and only contained cabbage) and the meat was scary! Good thing it's super cheap. Do NOT get the cheese-steak sandwich if you go even though it says #2 best seller it's awful! Okay on to service... Everyone seemed like they hated their job. Someone at my table asked for no tomatoes and add onions and of course she got tomatoes and no onions.Maybe I ordered the wrong thing and maybe they were all just having a bad day... Who knows.
