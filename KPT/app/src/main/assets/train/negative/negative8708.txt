Went here for a bachelorette party of 12 girls we had a reservation waited 10 minutes to be seated was seated a four different tables that we had to asked be pushed together.  We then sat at least 15 minutes before we were greater and our drink order was taken but the drinks took almost 25 minutes before arriving.  When our drinks did arrive the server ran off before taking our dinner order more time passes... we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably ~15-20 minutes.  When the food did come out three orders were missing completely our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found we sat waiting until finally she came by.  At this point we've been here well over an hour.  The manager comes by gets the food out says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table.  I didn't receive the drink promised by the manager and when I asked the server I got a look this was the first and only time I asked her about anything!?  She brought the drink as I was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues we explained that we had other commitments that it wasn't necessary.  Then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne at this point I'm pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face.  In the end the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown Charlotte I would chose another place next time.
