I just got back from dinner with my family at the old place and I can't emphasize enough my disappointment. The service was poor. Our waitress was a nice gal who was working hard she simply had too many tables because the place was woefully understaffed. Our drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner and she was usually too busy to check on us. I had to go and find her a few times to get things that were missed. I don't mind paying the high prices of the old place if the food is good. Unfortunately the food was a let down. Four of us ordered the French onion soup. The soup was so salty it was rendered uneatable. The steak was good but the baked potato was so dry I thought it left over from lunch. My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was quite bland. Everything else we ordered was just ok. To sum it up our meal was mediocre at best and we were all disappointed. Not one person on our party of seven really enjoyed their meal. I express my dissatisfaction with our waitress and she informed me that she would write my complaints in a book they kept. That was it. I left with the feeling that they were happy that they got my money and that they did not really care that my family's dinner was poor. They made no effort to make it right and they made no effect to ease my displeasure. This will be my last family dinner at the old place. I will take my business to a place that has better food and a place that values it's customers.
