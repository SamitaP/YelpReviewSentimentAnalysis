This Substation II used to be my favorite place to grab a quick bite... but this past year I've been really disappointed. Either my tastes have improved or the quality has gone downhill.The hummus wrap used to be my jam but lately it's been bland and water-ed down tasting... maybe it's the iceburg lettuce? I do really still like the quality and quantity of the hummus and feta they add but it seems the other toppings/condiments are lacking in quality.Recently I placed a take out order. Decided to try the 3-cheese veggie sub instead. They totally botched our order. Half of the toppings I asked for weren't there and things like tomato that I requested be excluded were in abundance... UGH!  The quality of the sliced cheeses were yummy but the wheat roll was dry and overwhelmed all the toppings.What's going on here?
