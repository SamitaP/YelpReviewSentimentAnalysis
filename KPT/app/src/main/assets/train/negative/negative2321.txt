good selection of beers* but the food is appalling. sysco-truk curly fries and run-of-the-mill hotdogs that don't even have natural casings. puh-leez. if you're gonna put dogz in the name of your restaurant at least try to serve something better than what you can get on sale at giant eagle. no joke: I prefer the O. their fries are made out of potatoes and their dogs have real casings. * and by good I mean good for PA where liquor laws are an absurd kafkaesque mess and a lindeman's geuze is about as interesting as it gets (for like $15 natch)
