It's got it's ups and downs.  It's got a reasonably attractive interior antique tin ceilings a broad selection of dozens of beers and a tasty looking menu featuring daily specials.  So why my low score?  D's at the other end of the block puts their beer collection to shame offering 1000 beers  Both times I've eaten here the wait to be served has been extremely slow (at least 30 minutes and up) the prices are a bit high ($10-$15 for a lunch entree) and most importantly the food is in general heavy and bland.  This is not a terrible place but with so many delicious spots nearby in regent square like the green mango map room d's and the square cafe you should keep on walking.  That said if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend you could definitely do worse but skip the boring food.
