If you're in a hurry don't come here. They crawl at a snail's pace. VERY SLOW.  I've been standing in line for 15 min. Finally got to order and I tell the guy sausage and egg on a plain bagel no cheese. You'd think my order was so complex. He couldn't remember what I ordered. If you're in a hurry don't come here.
