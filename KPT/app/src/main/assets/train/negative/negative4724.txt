Very expensive and quantity was quite less. I am an Indian and I love Indian food but their food gave me hard time in digestion; I suffered for 2 days. Price-wise too I wound't order again when I can have whole buffet at Tamarind at less than half price. I ordered chicken curry the one at Coriander Restaurant on Murray Ave is yummy but this one was so-so in taste mostly disappointing. I also ordered Samosa I find the poorly fried samosas of Bombay Mart better than these ones. Then I ordered tikki (aloo patty) really disappointed it looked several weeks old reheated in microwave. I know from 24 years of experience how fresh tikki tastes like. I like Indian restaurants in this order: Uddupi Tamarind Coriander Indian Carts at Pitt even Yuva India and All India more than this one. But definitely it's better than Prince of India where food smells like 2 week old and there is absolutely no taste in the food.
