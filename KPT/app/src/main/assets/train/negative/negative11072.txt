Their prices are reasonable & they deliver. Also the delivery service was quite fast. The food was where things started declining. The spring roll was fine probably came from a box but whatever. Crab Rangoon was terrible. For $3.75 I know they'll be using imitation crab..thats not really my beef..they were pretty flavorless except for the onion. Also ordered beef & mixed vegetable meh. They're certainly generous with their portions. But quality & flavor could seriously improve. Will I order again? Yes but thats just do to laziness.
