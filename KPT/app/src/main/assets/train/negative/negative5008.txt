I really want to give this place more stars but the food at Pho Van is so much better. Tram's Kitchen tastes like home cooking and it also feels like home with the owner's kids running around. But the bun thit nuong (pork vermicelli) was pretty sub-par even with my already low expectations for a Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh (we're Vietnamese from Cali so our expectations are usually really high!). The pork was so dry and tough it was inedible for me (though the bf ate all of his). The egg rolls were okay but just not the kind I'd sell at a restaurant. The spring rolls were edible yet I have to say the worst I've had (even I make way better ones). The waiter/owner(?) is really sweet and I feel a bit guilty for not supporting the restaurant but I'm sure those that love this place will keep it going strong. I'll try this place once more and hope to give it a better review next time!
