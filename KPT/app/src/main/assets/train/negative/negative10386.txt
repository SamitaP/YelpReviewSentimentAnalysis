I am sorry to be writing this review.  My first visit to Blue a few years ago was fabulous.  The service was very good!  But this time not only was the food not impressive but it was totally boring! The calamari appetizer was good but not worth $11.00.  The hummus appetizer was 2 golf ball sized clumps with almost no flavor.  Not even arranged to be appealing to the eye.  My tenderloin was nothing to write home about and the risotto was a mushy tasteless   glob with Carmelized onions on it that looked reheated...also not  flavorful.  The baked in house bread were blah and butter was not offered.  It could have used it to help the taste.  Dessert was the same...an amaretto cheesecake that tasted like it was left in the oven way too long....dry.   I love good food.  But this evening was an utter disappointment.  It was a birthday celebration and I did not want to spoil it with complaints about the food.  I also think my guest did not want me to feel bad for bringing them to this place I raved about prior to going. Service was great but the server talked me out of a couple of things I considered getting.  Made me think whomever was doing the cooking that night...A Saturday was not good at certain things.  Extremely overpriced.  Btw...coffee was $6.50.  C'mon now!  Good but not that much!  Sorry but I will not go back.  I was sooo looking forward to this special evening  and it was an utter disappointment.
