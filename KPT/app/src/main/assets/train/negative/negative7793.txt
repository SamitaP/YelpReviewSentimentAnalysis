If the idea of awkwardly taking a tour of the kitchen followed by a maze through overrated Italian singers only to be led to a picnic table of the worst food ever... You are in for a good time.  DISGUSTING! Worst Italian food ever! They shouldn't even call it Italian food. It tastes like a frozen lean cuisine. The bread was even bad. Overpriced! Don't waste your time and money going here. This place really should receive a total of negative stars but yelp wouldn't let us post.   Sad
