I eat there last week on a recommendation from a fellow employee.   I was by myself so I decided to eat at the bar.   The ambiance is very nice the lighting is pleasant and the noise level is reasonable for carrying on a conversation.   Good section of wine.  I was pleased with the calamari appetizer.   The special fish course for the evening was sea bass over roasted sliced potatoes.    What I got was well presented but not sea bass.  It was gray mealy oily and tasteless.  Sea carp?  To add to the experience the potatoes were under done.  Very disappointing.   I'm curious about the Italian dishes but not interested enough to go back and try Luce again.
