Harris Grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week.  However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.On a recent Thursday night my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.She was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again this time taking our order for food.She return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.Other waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.We waited a bit longer we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?
