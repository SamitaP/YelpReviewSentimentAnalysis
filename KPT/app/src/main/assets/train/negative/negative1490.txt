Maybe I just had a bad day.  This was THE WORST pizza I've ever had.  I have had Original DiCarlo's in Wheeling WV in several locations.  This is not even worthy of the name.  I got 3 extra cheese.  First off the pizza was basically glued to the wax paper.  The crust was unevenly cooked.  First bite the crust was almost raw dense and way too chewy.  The sauce tasted sour and the cheese (shredded not dices provolone like the Original) was slimy.  My second bite the crust was burned tasted burned but at least it was crunchy.  There was no third bite.  The remaining slices got tossed in the garbage.  This was by far the worst pizza I've ever had.
