I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. They are known for their southern Louisiana style dishes. I would say it's just pretty typical heaving-tasting foods. Their gyros are not bad actually but the creole with shrimp and blacken fish I had as a lunch special were just too salty and heavy for me. I'm sure some who love their soul food would appreciate it but it wasn't for me. It gets pretty crowded during lunch hours and the spaces are quite tight.
