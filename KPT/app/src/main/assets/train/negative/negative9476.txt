Pizza is like art. Your dough acts as a canvas and your tomato sauce is like the paint... ok I know cut the crap. It's just pizza.My mom came to visit this weekend and we found ourselves at the door of Fuel - the neon sign beckoning us in - so we accepted the invitation. First impression: Truck stop? Where is the gasoline smell? I mean if they want to go all the way authentic they should just put in a gas pump. Heck that would draw in plenty of people!We were the first ones there.. which was good because about 3 minutes later the line was out the door literally. We each got a slice. I kept it plain what can I say.. I'm a pizza minimalist. You can really tell a lot about a pizza place by the way a slice of cheese pizza tastes.. and this is.. average. Although I do love the thin crust I'm lost with the amount of grease. The sauce is good not to sweet but the cheese is sparse and knowing what you can get else ware makes it less worthwhile.I'd say this would be a good place to crash in a drunken stupor but for my sober days I'll head out to Rosario's in Concord. That's a real pie.
