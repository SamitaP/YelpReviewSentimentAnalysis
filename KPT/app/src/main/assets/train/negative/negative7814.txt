We like Longhorn but not this location.  The service here is mediocre at best.  Tonight it took 10 minutes to order drinkes at the bar 10 more minutes to get them and 10 minutes when we had to pay to go to our table.  When we go to the table it was not ready for us to sit and we had to wait until cleanup was finished. When we eventually got the appetizer the bread there were no plates around.  10 more minutes to get plates.When the food finally arrived there was only a passing similarity between the menu pictures and what we received. My Caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland.Worst experience in a long time.
