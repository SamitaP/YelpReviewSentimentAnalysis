This was my first Chinese food experience here in Pitt and I've gotta say guys I wasn't impressed.  This was also the first time in my life I've ordered from a Chinese restaurant where the lady taking the orders and the delivery guy were white.  Odd.  I suppose then I shouldn't have been surprised by the food.  My Moo Shu Chicken was mostly cabbage.  The pork dumplings were all dough and the dough was very thick and unappealing.  To end on a good note though the hot and sour soup was both hot and sour which you don't always find.
