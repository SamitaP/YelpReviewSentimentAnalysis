I hate to write a review like this in that I know the Owner's and his Dad. As a child I was able to meet them and grew up knowing Sonny.This location was kind of busy. Went in the door and waited for a while before one of the 20 people who worked there stopped goofing around and actually acknowledged the two groups and me and my son who had come in. Clearly this should have been an indicator of what was next.We were seated in a dirty booth and the family next to us looked very unhappy. It took about 15 minutes for anyone to come to the table. She took our drink order and left. In the mean time she delivered cold food to the family next to us that looked unhappy.about 10 more minutes and the people behind us who had come in with us finally met their server who was more than confused. We still had not gotten any drinks and not placed an order. The waitress came back to the table and asked about our drink order again. I gave her five minutes. When she came back and had nothing I gave up. I grabbed the manager on the way out and he looked like a deer in the headlights. He knew he had issues bad people and a huge problem. He was working in the kitchen when they got him and when a manager is in the kitchen it's bad news.While the front of the house was a wreck his employees where goofing off wandering around and most of them not doing anything to help the others out. This was clearly a case of bad hiring and could be fixed but that was a pure waste of 30 - 40 minutes.
