Sonny's was a little disappointing.  Now we went on Father's Day and dads eat free which was cool...if I had to pay full price for what I ate I would be very upset.  I got a rack of ribs...spare ribs.  Just because they are not baby backs it doesn't mean that they can't be tender people.  I don't understand how a pit smoked rib can be so tough and hard to get off the bone.  Its Fall off the bone and Stick to your ribs not Stick to the bone  The salad bar was the very definition of nothing special.  I don't think I will be craving the food anytime soon. What saved it was the service.  The kitchen screwed up our order and we had a large party but our server handled it very well.  I could tell that she had a long shift already but she was bright and cheerful towards us.  She covered the mistakes well and offered great service and was right on the spot with refills.  Don't think I'll be back unless Jim N Nicks and Macs Speed Shop burns down...together
