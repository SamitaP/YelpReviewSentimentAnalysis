3 people sat down...Interesting old house feel to the place. #1 - Etouffee shrimp - good shrimp pretty good spice to it nothing special that would bring me back#2 - Etouffee crawfish -  good crawfish but just like any other (customer 2 preferred this over the shrimp)#3 - Wash Day Blues - red beans and rice were blander than usual and the sausage was not cut up hot sauce only can do so muchFried Green Tomatoes appetizer was a hit with the whole table. Dixie Blackened voodoo was delicious.
