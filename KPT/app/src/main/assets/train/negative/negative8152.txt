I'm going to be the odd person and not give this place a glowing review.First off the atmosphere is actually cool.  This is a true pub.  Beautiful dark wood is everywhere.  The staff is also very nice no complaint there.The thing is I don't really have a complaint I'm just not impressed with the food.  I find it acceptable but nothing special.  In fact the menu is to me kinda boring.  I think the point of this place is more to go have a few after work and such.  When looking for great food in uptown this place wouldn't make my list.  I do love that it's locally owned and operated however and harbor no ill feelings.
