First of all I came with an open mind.  Read the other reviews thought it was a quaint place.  Great place for a couple of drinks and some appetizers.  The food on the other hand is NOT good.Spicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it.  It wasn't even spicy.  Not creamy more gelatin in consistency.   Please pass on it.The London Broil arrived medium well instead of medium rare.  Figured it was my error at being maybe misunderstood.  No the waiter was quick to tell me I ordered medium rare.  Took it back and returned with medium rare on the rare side just the way I like it.  By now my companions had finished eating.  The meat was so tough I gave up after a few pieces.  Nothing to write home about.Parking issue.  There is a parking lot two doors before the restaurant. There is street parking all around if you arrive early enough.  Personally it won't be an issue because I won't be venturing back anytime soon.  Don't understand the hype. It a neat place. More of the neighborhood bar.  Not a good dinner place.
