You may end up here on Sat night if all the other area bars are busy.I'm not going to come down too hard on this place because it wasn't my choice to come here. One of the locals led a group of guys here initially just to have 'one shot'. He lives in the Avenue and knows the bar owner and several of the staff.  We got quick and efficient service at a great priceand ended up staying for a few rounds of beers after a round of shots.This place is rough watch your back There is a lot of drama and the kind of place where testosterone mixed with alcohol can make for a volatile mix.
