Drive thru issues and rude manager. My order was wrong and there was no cars in the parking lot.  So Im not sure what their issue was today. When I made the complaint and asked to speak to the manager. She didn't care what I thought and dismissed me completely. She even rolled her eyes at me.I have been a customer here since the 1980s and have never been treated like this.  The food was as good as it always is. I recommend you avoid the tyvola location..
