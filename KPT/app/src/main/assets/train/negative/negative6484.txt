Food: the food at Harris grill is the epitome of average nothing is great and nothing is terrible everything is mediocre there are plenty of options for vegetarians and they have an unnatural love of bacon here the appetizers are more interesting than the entreesPrice: too expensive for the quality of the food the prices aren't staggering but considering the quality of the food it feels like you are overpaying for nearly everythingDrinks: beer is one of the strengths of Harris always a good selection of draft beers and an extensive bottle beer list the mixed drinks are all average to below average though and the bartenders do not mix good drinks aside from the signature Frozen Cosmo I would stay away from everything including the mojitoAtmosphere: this is what you pay for at Harris they have a beautiful porch for outdoor seating in the front an equally nice back porch and the inside decor is pleasant as well the menus are very cleverly organized and a lot of personality was put into the presentationService: the service is average at best we have had meals and specific orders confused multiple times service is also slow(+): great location great atmosphere good beer(-): overpriced food poor service worse bartendingWould I go back again? Only because I live nearby.
