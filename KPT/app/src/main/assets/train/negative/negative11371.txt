The owner could care less about customers. He is the rudest man. The food is so so. Nothing Cajun about it. They did not use our Groupon correctly. That was fine with us but why couldn't the server tell us. Not just toss the bill on the table and walk away. Save your money and dine elsewhere. The Cajun Yard Dog is far better and far more Cajun cuisine.
