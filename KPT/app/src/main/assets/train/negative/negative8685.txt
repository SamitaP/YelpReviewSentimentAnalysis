Go here if you enjoy waiting in the lobby when there are tons of open tables and being rudely treated by the hostess!  The food is just ok bar food.  The beer is awesome I will admit and the servers are pretty attentive.  I would rather drive down to Myrtle beach or Atlanta to it's sister restaurant Gordon Biersch.  The food is much better and the people who work there will treat you much better.  If you really need to go there to enjoy the beer I'd eat elsewhere and then just sit at the bar.
