Ugh! The worst food ever. Who serves a shrimp taco with cheese? There was no mention of cheese on the menu for the meal. The Manager was unwilling to comp my meal...they took a measly $3 off. The waitress asked what side i wanted and i chose a salad...we were charged for the side when my meal came with a side. Plus they didn't have the correct vodka for a drink listed on their drink list and they charged us for the more expensive substitute! Hands down NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! Slow service (even though we were the ONLY customers in place). And let us not forget the worst restrooms ever. For a place with NO customers other than ourselves the handicap stall was disgusting. Toilet clogged the sinks haven't seen cleanser in quite some time. Don't waste your time or money!
