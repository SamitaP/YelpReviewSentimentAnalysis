Ok.. Maybe I went here at the wrong time or something but I have to put in my two cents.  This is not a really cool hang out.  The bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly.  I went around 5pm on a Tuesday but I don't think that was the problem.  The place just seemed small and shabby to me.  Im sorry to bash it because there are a lot of really good reviews here.  So just take my review with a grain of salt.  I will update my review when I give it a second chance and make it through my beer and order some food.  Sorry guys.. I would say make your way deeper into the city and try someplace else.  I gave it one star at first.. That was too harsh.. -Ian M.
