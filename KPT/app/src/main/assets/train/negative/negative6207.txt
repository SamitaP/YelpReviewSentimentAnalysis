Decent bar atmosphere with dark wood and tavern like feel to it.  Being that it is a bar I was actually surprised by the amount of families. But a neighborhood bar to say the least. Came on St. Patty's weekend around lunchtime which meant this place was packed wall to wall. We eventually found a high top and were able to watch both the Pitt and Pens games. They have several TVs in all different angles which is really nice when it's packed and you don't really have to worry about finding a place near one single tv or anything. It was kind of a mess but because it was a packed holiday weekend I'll cut them a break. The food wasn't that good at all.. I had the Reuben sandwich and my friend had a chicken salad. Yes it's a bar but I've had good food at several bars before. The service was also overwhelmed and really slow. You would've been better off walking up to the bar and ordering a drink on your own. Needless to say it wasn't a horrible experience by any means but I wasn't impressed.
