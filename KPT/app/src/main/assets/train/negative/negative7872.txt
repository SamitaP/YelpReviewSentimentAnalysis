You know what Olive Garden is and so do I.  Despite being far from authentic I typically enjoy their food about once or twice a year.  This time we had a gift card so that was incentive enough to go.  They currently have a 2 for $25 which is okay but the portions are a lot smaller than their regular entrees.  Yes you get unlimited salad and breadsticks but it's just iceberg salad.  The deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share.  It was enough for the price but they should mention the portions are reduced.  Contrary to LR's review I have ALWAYS taken leftovers home from OG.  I easily ate the whole entree after eating salad and breadsticks.  Unless they just reduced their portion size since the last time I went these were definitely skimpy and did not come with that much chicken either.  The smoked chicken was decent.Our friend got the unlimited soup salad and breadsticks for dinner (yes they offer it for dinner for $3 more) but our less than friendly waitress snagged 2 of her breadsticks off of the table before she was finished. Why would you snag breadsticks from right in front of someone in the first place let alone someone who has them as part of their meal. The spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth.  All in all it's not that good and there are better places you could go and not have to wait 45 minutes for a table.  Try a real local Italian place like Libretto's up the road or Portofino's on Park Rd.  Their dishes are made by real Italian people not dreamed up in a corporate kitchen and they give you your money's worth.  Drive 5 minutes to Libretto's for real Italian food or 10 minutes to The Carolina Bistro.
