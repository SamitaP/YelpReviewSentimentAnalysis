Calabria's looks like a really beautiful restaurant from the outside. The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although when you go inside it is outdated and stuck in the 90s. I went to a bridal shower here which was elegant and beautiful compared to the regular restaurant area. The party room served breakfast foods later on in the day which seemed odd to me for a fancy party room. I would recommend this place for a party because it is separate from the restaurant itself but I am not impressed with the restaurant as a whole. The service was good the food is alright but the ambiance is just not there.
