The beer was pretty good but the food was a real disappointment.I have always enjoyed the beer at Rock Bottom and miss their location in Atlanta (Buckhead).We sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp.I had the pizza and it was mediocre at best.  The wings were fine but nothing special.  The restaurant was busy but wasn't packed.   Our food took a long time to come out.  We were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for 15 minutes.  It seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough but the servers weren't getting the food to the tables.
