No go. Bought the Groupon despite the other reviews and decided to give this place a try. The location atmosphere and service were all good so no complaints there. The food however was not. I ordered the general chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The chicken was all slimy dark meat and the flavor was nothing like general sauce but rather 100% strong garlic. I wasn't able to even eat hardly any of it because of the brown slimy meat. My husband ordered the garlic beef and he did not like the sauce at all. It had zero garlic taste was way too thick and overall wasn't very good. The egg roll was soft and mushy and is a shrimp roll so not your typical chicken/cabbage type. The place was super busy and I had high hopes but ultimately the food itself was not good and we will not be back.
