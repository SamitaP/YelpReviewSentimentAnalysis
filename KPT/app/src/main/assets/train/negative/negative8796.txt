I've been here quite a few times since i started working uptown. I usually get the sesame chicken and rice which is just okay at best. However today I got the chicken and broccoli with rice and it was just bad. The chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy. It's too bad they have a great location and everyone who works there is very nice but the food is borderline awful. Today was definitely my last visit.
