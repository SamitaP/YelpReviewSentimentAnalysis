Went there on 10/22/14. Service was nice. Server was nice but so ditsy. Ordered bruschetta. Came out fast but entr√©e's came out 50 mins later. Ordered eggplant parmigiana. Tasted burned. Waitress took my credit card and we waited almost 10 minutes for our credit card slip and she was so unorganized.
