I'm with Mike B. I have visited 2 Fox & Hound Bars now (the other up in Huntersville) - both get two thumbs down on the food. Both had good beer selection TVs and space. But the food - no. I got the fish sandwich at the Huntersville location - poor choice. I got the chicken sandwch at the Tryon location - looked like it belonged on the kids menu; and it took 30 minutes so it was also dry. I initially thought I'd give the place a 2nd chance - 2 for 2 bad food experiences is enough.
