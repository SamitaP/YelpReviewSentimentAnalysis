Y'ALL CLEARLY HAVE NEVER EATEN OUTSIDE OF CHARLOTTE. Mama ricotta's is a 1/2 step above olive garden now ive never eaten at an oliver garden but thats what i imagine. its pretty standard mediocre italian food that emphasizes alot of heavy cream to create flavorful dishes which is just so not italian. Not that there is anything wrong with mediocre italian food it fills you up but 4 stars is crazy. Both times ive had the penne alla vodka once again its pretty mediocre. Fried calamari was fried calamari it did not kill me but i laughed when they served it with hellmans chipotle mayo as the side (hello cocktail sauce? maybe a tomato sauce?). I will say its rather inexpensive so compared to a luce or vivace i can see this being a fan fav.
