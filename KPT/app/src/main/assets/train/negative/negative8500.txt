This happened a while ago (several months) but it still haunts me today.I ordered a portabello mushroom burger (I know not really Irish but don't judge). When my burger came out it was not a portabello mushroom patty but instead a pile of sliced mushrooms on the bun. I asked the server why it was not a portabello patty and the server told me it was because they had run out of portabello patties and this was what they were using instead. Interesting. I told him I didn't want this and wanted something else. He obliged took my plate of sliced mushrooms and went to place my new order. I called the manager over to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story he rebutted with something Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms. WHAT?! I told him no that was incorrect and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't!) although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger...gee thanks.Now I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal. But come on. I would assume after having worked in the restaurant industry for several years that the manager regardless of how much/little he believed the customer (me) would side w/ me or at least try to rectify the sitatuion for future business. But no instead he stuck w/ his server made an unhappy customer and now I will not visit there on my own volition (my wife enjoys the place so I will go back w/ her only urging).
