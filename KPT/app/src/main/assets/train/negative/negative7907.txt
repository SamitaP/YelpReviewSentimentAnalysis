Currently here at the restaurant. It's noisy crowded disorganized and there are not enough waiters. In our case we got out appetizer and our entree with about a 2-3 minute seperation. They had not even cooled enough to eat them before we got the entree. We were not the only one either the people next to us had the same thing happen with an even shorter delay. So lets move onto the entree... Two steaks both looked good on the outside. One ordered medium the other medium rare... Both are RARE beyond rare. Giant red center all the way to the edge. This place is to expensive for the level of service that they provide.So after this bad experience why did I give a two star review instead of a one.... Because the potato skins were delicious
