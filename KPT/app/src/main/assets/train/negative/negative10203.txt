I was looking forward to my first visit to Aquavina but came away disappointed.   I'm quite easy to please food wise so this experience was a surprise to me.  This restaurant is relatively pricey so perhaps my expectations were high based on what I perceived would be value for my dollar.We dined on a surprisingly quiet Friday night. Even so the service was adequate - nothing more nothing less.  Not very friendly and welcoming just adequate.As for the food.  We started with the blue crab fondue served with french baguette toasts which was absolutely fabulous.  I'd definitely recommend this dish but don't eat too much or you'll have no room left for the entrees to come.   Entrees were ribeye with roquefort cheese sauce and my companion ordered the petit filet mignon.  Sides are ordered separately; we selected grilled asparagus and potato gratin. The portions are quite generous but the presentation was way off for me.  My ribeye arrived on a big plate with a large portion of roquefort smeared across the top looking quite lonely without something (anything) to make it look appealing.  Yes I know the sides are served separately so that limits how the dish might be displayed but more could have been done to appeal to the eye.  All in all the food was adequate (except the delicious fondue!).  But I expected a much better experience for the price.  I don't mind spending money to go out and have a delicious meal and lovely experience.  But I do expect just that - a delicious meal and a lovely experience.
