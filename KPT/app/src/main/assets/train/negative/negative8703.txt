first off we walked in for a bigger table (6) and watched the manager who didn't address us at ALL make the host who had an injured arm put together 2 tables and rearrange the chairs without any help. The manager even made eye contact and still couldn't even say hello to us or the 2 people behind us waiting as well.  The server provided great service and the beer was good. The food was another story. The burgers were over done and the personal pizza was burnt on the bottom and missing cheese from a whole slice. I made pizzas in a deli for a few years and I must say I don't know how you can do that but there's a first time for everything. The house salad was 90 % white and 10 % green weak! All in all the pizza got replaced and taken off the bill but was that enough to entice a return visit? Maybe for a beer.....
