I received a free entree coupon for my birthday from Tony Roma's so I used to it to get some takeout since I am alone this week and my husband is gone on a business trip. Otherwise I would have brought him with me and we could have dined in! I'd never eaten here before so I thought it would be great to give their food a test run.The girl who brought my food out (hostess I assume by outfit) walked over with a straight face and asked me if my name was the one on the to go order. It was. She handed me the food and still with a straight almost unfriendly face asked for the coupon. I handed it to her and gave her a tip also. I always tip even on free food! I was a server for 2 years at Red Lobster. She didn't smile once and gave off a very unfriendly almost hostile vibe. Really made me sad. She made me feel like crap for using the coupon that the company sent me!! And I gave her a tip!! Its not like she got nothing out of it!I ordered the steakhouse burger (was craving a yummy burger since Im pregnant) and fries. The fries were bad. Not crispy but chewy and not very salty. The burger was pretty yummy but was slopped in the box carelessly. :/ Doesn't seem like good customer service. This was my test run and I know not to go back and take my husband now.
