I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini which was about 90% breading 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.I had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera which was strangely enough very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand to her credit) and again not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.
