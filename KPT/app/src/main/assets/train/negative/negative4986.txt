I've been to Tram's Kitchen a few times with friends and I hear good things from people about this place.  Personally I don't see what is so special about it.  It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle broth herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.  That said the service is nice.  However I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).  I prefer dining at Pho Minh to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings.
