My husband and I headed over early on a Tuesday night.  To our surprise it is buy one get one tapas until 7 so upon realizing our luck we opted for 4 items to test the place out.  We were glad we did.1)  Chicken satay: chicken was tender and the seasonings were minimal but the peanut sauce looked like it was scooped out of a jar was thicker than peanut butter with a sticky texture.2) Lucky 7 Roll: The menu says that it is homemade but if it is I think it has since been reheated.  It had an interesting mix of flavors but the outside tasted more like a thin corn taco.3) Crostini (Filet Mingon): 3 small flavor and lifeless filets over jam on a white bread crostini.4) Souvlaki (beef skish-kabobs): Again light on flavor over cooked.I don't recommend this place at least for tapas and I won't go back for a full dinner but the atmosphere was laid back the service was very good and if you work in the area it seems like a good spot to stop in for a drink.  That said living in 4th ward there are so many other choices on my walk between here and there I probably won't make it intentional to go back.
