I came here for lunch during work.  The food was decent but 2 issues 1 major one.  First - the water at this establishment is disgusting.  My friend got water with ice and it was awful and so I got water without ice and it was just as awful.  And I don't mean a slight aftertaste... it was very apparent to both of us that something was wrong with it.  It tasted like metal or plastic.  Which makes me worry that the water they use in cooking and other drinks like ice tea or lemonade is contaminated with something.  Second issue not as huge but we both ordered a sandwich and the waitress didn't bother to ask what side we wanted - We didn't realize it came with a side until the food showed up with fries.
