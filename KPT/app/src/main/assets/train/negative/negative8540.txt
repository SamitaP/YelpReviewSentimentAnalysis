I have had Chinese food in a bunch of different cities including NYC and San Francisco to name a few. So far I have not found a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. If you go to Soho for pick up don't follow their address to the T because it is actually on the other side of the building next to Fuel Pizza. Call ahead when you are about 5 minutes away and they will come outside to deliver your food. As far as the food goes the dumplings are a little too doughy but the sauce is quite good. I would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland. I am not going to X this place out just yet I may give it another shot. Still looking for a good Chinese Food place here in Charlotte wish me luck!
