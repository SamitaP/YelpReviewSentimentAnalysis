I'd like to eat there again because they had SO many choices and I want to try their sushi. I got the ginger lunch which was good but not as good or flavorful as it could be. It was just kinda meh. But the service was fast which was nice and they did a good job of keeping up with refilling our glasses. I'd go again and next time I might order something with either more spice or a different kind of cuisine all together.
