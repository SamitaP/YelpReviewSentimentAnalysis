I order frame Angelo's regularly .Quality in going downhill.First I waited on hold for 10min so I drive over and I'm still on holdI go in there's one person inside and no orders ..WTF am I holding for .?...So my order is $30+ and I asked for a ranch and of course I have to pay for it ?Then I get my white pizza home and it looks like it was in a tornadothis seems to be happening more often..and delivery don't get me started.My rating is PISS POOR!!!
