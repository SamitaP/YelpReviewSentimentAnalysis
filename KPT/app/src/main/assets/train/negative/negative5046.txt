First of all Tram's has been cited by the Allegheny Health Department for code violations like not storing meat at proper temperatures. I also personally know several people who have gotten violently ill from eating there. If that's not enough to stop you read on.I feel like people who like this place are confusing dirty & mean with authentic. The staff are unpleasant and it doesn't feel like a place you'd want someone cooking food. And finally sure all of this could be different if the food was good but in my opinion it is not. Bland and disappointing the Pho most of all. Pittsburgh has so many great asian restaurants including other Vietnamese options that I don't see any reason to eat here.
