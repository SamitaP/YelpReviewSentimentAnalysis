The lo mein is so bad. It was spongey and tasted like plastic. The sweet and sour chicken is just fine. It is what I expect from a chinese take out place. (You can sit in) I probably won't be going to this place unless I have limited options approaching 10:00pm. This place could make a killing if it stayed open till 12am-2am on weekends.
