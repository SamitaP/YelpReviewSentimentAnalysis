:( My first trip here was on a Sunday at 4pm. I was surprised to see I was the only customer. We were met by friendly staff took our choice of seat and gazed at the menu. I wanted a verity so I picked the 2 pancakes 2 eggs toast sausage or bacon.I ordered my eggs scrambled and sausage links. I also ordered home fries and a glass of white milk. I could smell my food cooking as I waited anxiously ( I was starving)My food was ready in about 8 minutes and looked tasty.All in all good bargain and equal food quality I'll give them 2 stars.Like a Pirmantis it would probably be better if I had been drinking.
