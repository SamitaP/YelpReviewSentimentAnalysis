This place is pretty poor and really needs to get it's act together because it's a disgraceful place to watch football especially given the accessibility of technology these days.  First off it is desperately in need of some updates.  There are old crappy projector screens and a few big rear projection TVs but not an HDTV in sight.  There are TVs aplenty but they just feel dinghy and outdated and the reception on every TV is snowy.The biggest issue however is that apparently they're only able to show 6 games at any 1 time throughout the huge bar area.  There are several main bar islands booths and pub tables all over with individual TV screens at each booth.  Sounds good but what good are all these seats if you can only show 6 games?  That is absurd when you consider how huge Sports Rock is especially during college football.  I went to watch a game that was on regular old ESPN and they weren't showing the game.  You mean I could go to my hotel to watch the game but am unable to watch it at a sports bar??  Give me a break.Food is also generally terrible.  Nachos are no better than what you can get at 7-11 and sandwiches have no flavor.  And service is piss poor and understaffed.  I'm not sure if they recently changed ownership or what but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football season.I feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game I think I'd still rather watch it in my hotel room.
