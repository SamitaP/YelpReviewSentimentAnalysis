Got into Pittsburgh late this evening and this was the only place around that was still open and delivered after 11 pm. I give them a half star for this. They have a few vegetarian choices on the menu. I give them another half star for this. I ordered what I thought would have the most vegetables the vegetable calzone. They ended up delivering a Mediterranean calzone which was also vegetarian but it wasn't what I ordered. The small portion of vegetables was tasty and most of them seemed fresh so I give them another half star for this. I didn't bother to ask if anything was organic.They told me it would be about a 45 minute wait but it ended up being closer to 30 and the delivery guy was friendly. I give them another half star for under-promising and over-delivering. This place might be great for people who love fresh made bread and lots of cheese but it's not a vegan delight!
