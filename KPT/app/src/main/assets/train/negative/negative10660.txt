I'll give that their food is really good....but diners beware....my husband and I ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad and Chicken Pasta with Broccoli - when you order salad and pasta you expect to have cheese with it right?  We didn't want the cheese on the salad and pasta so we asked for it on the side - and we got exactly that.....then we get the bill and my husband noticed that they charged us 50cents each for the salad and pasta cheese that we asked for on the side.......really? We immediately called the manager and he said that it is the restaurant policy to charge for cheese - I said that is ridiculous because salad and pasta SHOULD come with cheese and the fact that we wanted it on the side instead of on the food should not be an issue and we shouldn't be charged (I know it's only a total of $1.00 extra for both cheese but that is not the point.....the point is for what they charge for food it SHOULD come with cheese).With this said they do have good food and I just wish they were not trying to gouge their customers for every penny.  We'll have to think about going back to this establishment.
