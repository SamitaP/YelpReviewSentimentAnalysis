I was in a time-crunch and starving and chose this Sonny's over some nearby chain restaurants. I'd been to a Sonny's a couple years back on a visit to Florida (when I was living in NY) and thought it was decent reasonably priced BBQ. Now that I live in NC and frequently travel to the BBQ capitols of the world (TX TN SC NC) I know what the best BBQ should be. In fact just a week before I'd had some of the best BBQ I'd ever eaten on a visit to Fort Worth. By comparison the grub at this place was not nearly as good as what I'd remembered it to be. My chicken was bone dry the ribs were small and dry and the pulled pork was ok but unremarkable. That said my server was friendly the cost was low the food came fast and there was a decent amount of food for the price. I probably won't return to a Sonny's again unless I'm in a similar jam to this past time.
