Had great service until we got our food. Took one bit into my pasta and a brillo pad was on my fork!!!! I was disgusted. I asked to speck to the manger and she told me  it's acceptable for these kinds of things to happen in restaurants. I will not be going to any restaurant if Brillo pads are going To end up in my food. Yes I know sometimes things could land I'm my food. I.e hair but a Brillo pad is something that can't go unseen. I contacted Applebee's human resources and they were great. No complaints there very friendly and easy to work with called back was very impressed.
