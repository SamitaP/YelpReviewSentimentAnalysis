Ugh...don't waste your time or your money!  I would have given it zero stars but the Mei Fun and the Pepsi were actually decent.  The buffet has the typical Chinese fair but the only thing I could come close to suggesting would be the fried shrimp Mei Fun and maybe the sweet and sour chicken.  Skip everything else!!!!Don't even think about eating the sushi.  I was feeling adventurous so I grabbed a few of the sushi rolls that I easily recognized (california cucumber).  One of them tried to crawl off the plate before I got back to my seat!  The rolls were chewy and just plain gross makes my stomach turn to think about it.Service was polite and good on the refills.Enter at your own risk!
