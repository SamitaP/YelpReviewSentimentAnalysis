I took an out-of-town guest here for dinner.  Our hopes were up as we walked up to the building and then entered.The restaurant was busy with two private parties; however we were seated upon arrival and there was still plenty of seating available.First off the beer menu.  They have a fairly decent selection of drafts and bottles--think an extended list of your usual German suspects (Spaten Franziskaner Warsteiner etc.).  Ultimately I wasn't very impressed.The bill of fare had a decent amount of variety and the descriptions made narrowing a selection difficult.  Fortunately the sampler special of the evening provided a convenient choice!I started with the bowl of Hungarian Goulash.  The portion was quite large.  However I found the broth somewhat too salty and the meat chunks were dry and tough.Like the soup I found my entree to be a little too salty which was disappointing because the spaetzle and red cabbage were otherwise quite nice.  I found the meats to be somewhat dry and tough similar to that of the goulash.  All of this was too bad because the portions were easily large enough for two meals.Finally I'm guessing dry must be a theme at this place because even the black forest cake was also a little dry.For the record:  I didn't complain nor send any of the food back out of respect for my guest.  I just didn't want to create a scene in front of my guest.Waitstaff were prompt enough but our server kept forgetting drink orders and generally just seemed nonchalant about providing good service.So minus one star for the ditzy waitress.  Minus 1.5 stars for the food.  I rounded down because I disagree with the more positive reviews.  I was expecting something stellar and I feel rather let down.I will come back and give them one more chance but only one more chance.
