It's MCDONALDS! You wanted a review.. Ok keep your panties on... here it is...The place is always slammed (yay for fast food).. You think going into a drive-thru is fast.. It's not. Make sure you check your order as it often comes back wrong - the place is run by 16-19 year olds I swear to god. It's a clean place. Well there's something.. It's fast food so you don't have to cook - although I don't know why I'm saying fast in anything because they are not here.. Lastly it's on the way through Mt. Holly on the way to 85. And that's your 20 second review.. I warned ya.
