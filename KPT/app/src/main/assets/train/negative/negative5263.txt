Never understood all the hype about this place. The burgers are rather bland and burnt.  No fries only their potato things which are NOT as good as any fry I have ever had.  And the wait was always ridiculous to boot.I admittedly haven't been here in a few years but it doesn't seem like this is the type of place that would have changed.
