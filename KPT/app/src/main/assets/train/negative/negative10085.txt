Definitely a fun place to go...but dress code is way too strict during night club time.  Apparently you have to have a collar shirt to get it...I've worn regular shirts (nice ones of course) many times and had no problem getting in.  Oh well it's a private club so I can't argue it but I'm still only giving them 2 stars.
