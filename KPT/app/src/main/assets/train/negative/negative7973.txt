Okay I know this is just an IHOP so I shouldn't expect culinary excellence.  But.We've been to this location a couple times.  They do breakfast VERY well.  Their coffee is always fresh and hot.  Their pancakes are always fresh and hot.  Their orange juice is never too tart never too sweet.  I've never found foreign items in my food.  Wait staff is always courteous and helpful.But.Beware - when you order NON-breakfast items you may not end up with a satisfying meal.  This past weekend I took my daughter and my grandmother to the IHOP for a quick & cheap post-church lunch.  My grandmother ordered coffee and a belgian waffle - she said it was very delicious.  My daughter got the baby cakes kids meal and she ate most of it.  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the side.  The chicken fried steak was so tough as to be inedible (I took a couple bites and left the rest).  The mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning.  I took one bite and when I realized I was eating aged potatoes I left the rest.  The corn was the best thing on the plate.  Needless to say when we got home I made myself a sandwich since I didn't really get lunch at the IHOP. *lol*As I said we've been to this location before and they definitely do breakfast right (which makes sense given what an IHOP is).  My daughter and grandmother were very satisfied with their meals.  But stick with the breakfast menu.  Don't venture anywhere near the non-breakfast menu.  Then you should be fine.
