Came here for lunch with my pops who was fiending for their $6.95 soup/salad/breadsticks extravaganza. He is a huge fan of this deal but unfortunately did NOT receive it since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon and they only offer their lunch specials on WEEKDAYS.Another slight issue I had was the fact that the waiter messed up my order but the manager gladly replaced it free-of-charge for me and gave me her humble apologies. Once I received the dish I ordered - beef medallions over fettuccine alfredo - it was actually pretty tasty. It featured green onions chives sauteed spinach and tasted pretty fresh discounting the strong vinaigrette coating on the steak. My dad would have given this place four stars but I am not my dad!
