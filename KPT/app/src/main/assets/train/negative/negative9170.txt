Although I have been using yelp for many years this is my first review. My husband and I went to Mert's on Sunday morning around 1015. It was not full so we were seated immediately right next to the server station. We watched server after server at least 5 of them pass our table to put orders in the computer server after server chat with each other not one addressed our table. Not one said I will be your server I will be with you shortly. Not one said would you like some water. Not one said let me find who your server is. Not one. This went one for 15 minutes before we decided to get up and leave!  The service is terrible!!!
