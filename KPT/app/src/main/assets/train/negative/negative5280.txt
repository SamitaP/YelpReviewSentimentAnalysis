I know it's a Pittsburgh institution and we're supposed to rave about it and declare it the best in the burgh. It's not. Not even close. I've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe I missed something. Maybe it was me. Oh but it's not. It's not me. It's just not that good. Over hyped underperformed. Burgers are adequate - nothing special. Order something other than a burger and you don't get much better. Years ago it might have been worthy of its reputation since there weren't a lot of competitors. Now forget it. Burgers are ubiquitous and great ones are everywhere. Best burger in the city is at Kaya - the Kaya burger. Tessaro's - a fading icon of days gone by.  Enjoy the crowds convince yourself your getting the best that you're in the know. You're  not.
