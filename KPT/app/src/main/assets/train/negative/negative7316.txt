Remember that saying that sex is like pizza - even when it's so-so it's good? That pretty much sums it up. There's nothing appallingly wrong with the Pizza Co. pizza. It's just kind of ho-hum. With that said I enjoyed the chili poppers a lot. (Which were inexplicably wrapped with the ranch sauce for delivery. Mmmmm....hot sweaty ranch dressing.)The delivery guy was really friendly. Delivery time was unimpressive. A full 45 minutes mid-afternoon and I live two blocks away? That's what I get for being lazy probably. Karmic pizza. Prices are pretty good though so that's a bonus. They may end up being my 'Dangit I've only got fifteen bucks!' joint. Otherwise probably not.
