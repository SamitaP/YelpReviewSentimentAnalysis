havent been there since i was a kid with my parents and after last night i will not go back. who's ever heard of bland cajun food well somehow they pulled it off. i can make far better cajun food that at least has taste. the gumbo was terrible and the grits from the shrimp and grits were even worse thank goodness they had habanero sauce to add some taste to this miserably bland dish. they did have dixie lager and dixIes blackened voodoo lager which is the only reason theyre not getting one star. the bartender was not pleasant either she obviously did not want to be there and it showed when there are only 3 people in front of you you should keep their water glasses full and beers a-comin' .  the band was nice and the place itself is nice but im never going back hotel charlotte danny's too and especially boudreaux's are all much better with regards to cajun creole cuisine
