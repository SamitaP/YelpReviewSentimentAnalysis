Now I really try to like this place  especially since my fiancé lived in Germany for a few years and when I took him here with friends for his birthday he proposed to me . So of course it is special to me for other reasons. However this site is to help review the food and to be honest I just think it's bland and incredibly boring.. The only items I care for are the red cabbage and the dumplings other than that I have tried several different things because my fiancé gets in the mood for German food and this is the only place in Charlotte we know of .. Other than for sentimental reasons though I personally would not chose to eat here.
