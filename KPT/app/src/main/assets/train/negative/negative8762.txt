The sanitation score for this place was 93.0.....I guess that was a red flag that I missed before I placed my order.I will start with the 'good'. The cashier was very polite inviting and helpful. Thank you.The cornbread was 'decent'. Hooray that it wasnt the Jiffy brand.Now the 'bad' ( and I mean REALLY bad!)Remember that stuff we called 'mystery meat' in grade school? Well apparently it's still around except now they bury it under BBQ sauce and call it meatloaf at Simmons restaurant. Arrrggghhh! The baked chicken w/dressing was 'do-able' but you can get the Banquet frozen chicken entrees at your local grocery and do much better. The food was horrendous! The broccoli casserole was watered down and over cooked....soggy. Seems like they used imitation cheese because it certainly didnt melt. (I even nuked it 4 minutes on HIGH in the microwave.....nope it didnt melt). The so-called brown gravy was tasteless and bland. Don't waste your time....
