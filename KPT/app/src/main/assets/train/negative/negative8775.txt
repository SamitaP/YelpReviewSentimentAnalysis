Oh Presto my experience here was just - not - good.  First my rating of 2/5 stars is based primarily on the food not the service.  I dined with a friend on a week night.  The restaurant was pretty empty no wait for a table.  Our server was friendly and adequate not magnificent.I decided to give Presto a try since they had a groupon coupon a while back.  So I had some money to spend and Iwas able to taste quite a few dishes.  We started off with two appetizers: calamari and crab dip.  Calamari was very good; however the sauce was well gross.  It was overly sweet and had an odd flavor.  We just ignored this and ate the calamari as is.  The crab dip was another disappointment.  We were given plenty of chips way more than we had dip for which is never a great sign.  The cheese had a Velveeta consistency which I absolutely despise!  The cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor.  Toward the bottom there were whole chunks of crab...and you guessed it...now without any cheese!  I ordered the lasagna which came with a salad.  I ordered the Caesar salad.  Wow this was just embarrassing (for them).  It was literally chopped Romaine with bottled dressing (I'd bet all my money - Ken's Steakhouse non-creamy kind).  I had about 4 bites and just put it aside.The lasagna.  Well remember that sauce with the calamari?  That's what is in the lasagna!  I actually had to send the dish back.  I was so disturbed by this sauce that I HAD to ask what was in it.  Well tell me what you think - tomato sauce with cinnamon and brown sugar.  I traded it in for a sandwich.  I just didn't know what to do.  I got a veggie sandwich with fries.  As a PS - bread was over saturated with oil but veggies tasted good.  Fries were under seasoned.  Not going back but I think this place may be better as a lunch destination.
