This place is failing in every way: their service is dismal their food is greasy/tasteless/disgusting and the kitchen/dining room are absolutely filthy. I have no idea how or why they continue to remain in business but I would suggest that if you ever must make the mistake of consuming this disgusting excuse for food then for goodness sake dine in.
