I went to this place because I had a LivingSocial voucher. Even with this voucher I feel like I paid too much money. I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine. I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.The only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM so if you are desperately starving not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocer's freezer this might be a tolerable food option.  Again it is advisable to be desperately starving.
