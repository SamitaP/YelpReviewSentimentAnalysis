This is the kind of pizza where the toppings are added after the crust is cooked. Cheese included. It's a novelty and for some folks it's their favorite pizza. The taste is good if a little weird but for me it didn't satisfy my pizza craving.This location was crowded and the wait was long but the people were nice.
