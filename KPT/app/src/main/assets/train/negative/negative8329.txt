My pasta tasted like rubber I think they might have served me the display.  The crowd here was pretty rowdy and entertaining but my dinner was no good.  I guess I don't enjoy mainstream bars like this one.  There are a lot of attractive people around but I really didn't have a lot in common with the other patrons.  If you like kind of preppy establishments you would enjoy this place..  It just isn't up my alley though.  I do have to say that it was clean and all of the employees know what they are doing though.
