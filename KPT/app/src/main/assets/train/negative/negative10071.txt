Yeeeeaah I know it's y'know power lunch by day and disco by night but wow was the dinner I had here underwhelming. Like boring oily scant salad meh fries expensive bland beer selection. Our waitress was gone - either invisible dropping things loudly and whisking off like she hadn't just startled the beejeezus out of us or just that warm mix of fed up/bored/seriously you want something? kind of service that screams for a 5% tip.Somehow still managed to spend 20 bucks a head. And that'll be the last time I visit Cosmos.
