A very lovely name for a very terrible resturant. The food is bland bland bland. How this place can serve such flavorless food and stay open for years is beyond me. The inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained. I decided  to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce. The sauce was slimy and the broccoli was water logged and over cooked.  As if it has set in a pot of luck warm water for hours before being served to me. I'm noticing a theme of horrible resturants on 6th Street and I don't like it.
