AAahhh.  Why do I have such a discordance with Pittsburgh Yelpers' opinions of sushi places?  This place is not 4 stars.  The long line -- one person Andy making the sushi makes you think it's a gem in the Strip District.  Eh.With Andy's Special there was a variety of rolls and made with a continuous strip of seawood (ie inside on one roll outside on the next) which I actually found annoying as the rolls fell apart when trying to separate them.  There just wasn't any flavor -- so I laid on the soy sauce and wasabi but to no avail.I'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments.
