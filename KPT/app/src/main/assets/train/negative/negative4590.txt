This is by far the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been to. The servers are rude and slow and the food is awful. Everything pretty much looks and tastes the same. The waiter seemed annoyed that my eating partner complained that his soda was flat and brought him another flat soda. When he complained again the waiter told him to see the host on the way out.  If you are in the area there are many better choices for a good meal other than this place.
