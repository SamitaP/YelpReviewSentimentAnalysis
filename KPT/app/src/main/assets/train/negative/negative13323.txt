Gone downhill.  Service was awful.  Ordered soup their special shrimp dish and pork fried rice.  The soup was served and that was the last we saw of our waiter for 45 minutes.  People who arrived well after us were served and left.  When finally the entree arrived it was relatively without taste.  Once we'd finished we sat watching for our waiter who never showed before I got up went of the cashier and asked for a check.  This has been one of our regular neighborhood go to restaurants for take out and dine in.  NEVER AGAIN!
