Location:4050 Penn Ave PittsburghPrice: $ 1/2Service: GoodMy family was really hungry and everywhere my parents visit they always want to try native food. So I search Viet restaurant on the GPS and it lead us there- I mean if it was apart of the GPS' top 10 it must be good. I feel like being Vietnamese made me more critical on the food when I do go to Vietnamese restaurants. It is in a residental neighbourhood downtown.You're able to park along the streets. It was a very humble environment and very cute. The service was okay they were really nice and never rude. We ordered Pho (of course...) com tam pad thai and bun. It all tasted plain;the Pho was a little off the pad thai wasn't spicy or had enough of the sweet/sour taste to it. The portions were really small. I definitely feel like my GPS lied to me and that I've experienced better.
