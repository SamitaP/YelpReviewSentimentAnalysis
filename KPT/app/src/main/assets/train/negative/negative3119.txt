My family always wanted to try Primanti. What a huge disappointment at the Anchor drive one. The pizza was served with a mound of burnt ashes on the bottom. Not a little but teaspoons of it all over. The ovens are not cleaned. I ordered the fish sandwich which came out cold a soppy mess from the oil on the bread and a chunk of coleslaw core inedible. My sons was no better. The waitress saw we had taken only one bite and asked if we wanted to take home. We both said 'no way.' She didn't flinch and didn't care. I don't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid. In Philly they'd be out of business in a heartbeat. It is also a dirty noisy unkempt premises.
