My first time eating here will more than likely be my last. Im big on customer service and i did not like the fact that when i got up to go use the rest room i returned just to have the rest of my food thrown away and after i asked the manager if i could get 5 shrimp like i had he said sorry my food got thrown away but it would be $2 per shrimp if i wanted more. I had just spent $30 there and that was totally wrong that really put a sour taste in my mouth and i will not be a returning customer!
