I only had Pho so I can't judge the rest of the food but the Pho was the worst I've ever had. Biggest let down ever as I drove here once and it was closed and came back excited to get my fill of Pho at what's apparently the best place in Pittsburgh but  left feeling sad. The broth tasted like water and amount of beef and noodles you get was pathetic.
