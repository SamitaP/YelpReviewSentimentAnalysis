We visited with a Groupon last Thursday. We ordered the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup the black bean chicken szechuan beef and lamb with scallions. The soup was awesome! Very spicy!The rest of the food was awful. It was tasteless... the meat had a weird fluffy texture.... there was zero flavor. It was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager. He said the kitchen would make new dishes. They brought three new entrees. They were again completely flavorless but warmer. I couldn't taste salt or pepper  or garlic or even feel any heat. It was awful. We paid and left. yuck. I used to go here as a child. I remember the sushi was always good. Maybe that is the thing to order!
