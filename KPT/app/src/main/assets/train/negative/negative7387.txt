I ordered from this place and the staff was INCREDIBLY rude when they delivered my order. The woman not only rang my doorbell 5 times but she BANGED and I mean BANGED on our window of our house without even a second of wait in between. When I opened the door the woman threw my food at me and told me never to order again as she called me TWICE with no answer (my fianc√© was upstairs sleeping with his phone but our home is clearly marked and we've never had problems before). I handed her the money and told her I wasn't giving her a tip then and she LOST IT. I closed the door and she walked away. What in the actual heck? You guys lost a customer forever and I'll never recommend you to anyone. That was insanely rude.
