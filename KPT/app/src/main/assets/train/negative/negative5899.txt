I'll second the other reviewer that said for the price charged the amount of food you receive doesn't measure up. Furthermore Pittsburgh still has yet to have any quality schawarma. I ordered both the beef and chicken schawarma to sample. The beef:- clearly frozen boxed 'steak-ums' as opposed to freshly shaved off a doner.- a measly 2 slices at that I basically had a wrap of lettuce and tomato w/ a hint of beefThe chicken:- clearly a once frozen and somewhat freezer burnt sliced chicken breast again as opposed to being freshly sliced off a doner and a mix of white and dark meat. this leaves the meat dry and tasteless. - maybe a half of a chicken breast if I was luckyNo toum or similar sauce served at all with either dish?!?! That's hitting a whole new low for fake schawarma. Hostess was great service was adequate. I have no motivation to return. Hopefully one day Pittsburgh will have good choices when it comes to Greek and Med. food. Today is not that day.
