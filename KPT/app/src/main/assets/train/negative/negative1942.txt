My husband and I had this pizza for the first time last night.  He suggested it after hearing recommendations from friends.  This was the most disgusting excuse for a pizza I've ever had! We ordered pizza for pick up.  The girl told my husband 20 minutes and he picked our pizza up in a timely fashion.  The best thing about this pizza was the crust.  That was it! It was cold! It was not even warm like it had been warmed up before my husband picked up our order.  We got two extra toppings which were just heaped in a pile on the middle of our slices.  These were cold too. And mushrooms from a can!!! Why am I paying extra for disgusting canned vegetables.  The sauce had absolutely no flavor and was completely cold. I would never go to this place ever again.  It was a lazy excuse for a pizza.  Who gives someone a COLD pizza for pick up?!?!?
