C'mon folks w/all the great places to get a steak in the Charlotte area from Longhorn pricing to high dollar steaks elsewhere why is ANYONE going to Longhorn??...its never been more than an OK steakhouse at its best and that locations glory days so to speak have been in its rearview mirror for probably 5+ years.....
