Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside inside and in the bar area.We were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.The food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.Two stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise it would have been pretty good.
