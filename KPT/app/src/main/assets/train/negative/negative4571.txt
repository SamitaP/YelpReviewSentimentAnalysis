Uggh.  I wanted pho really bad but theirs tastes like warm ramen broth with 4 little pieces of meat in it.  Got the fried spring rolls too and they charged $5-6 for four little rolls that were obviously prepackaged frozen spring rolls.I gotta stop trying out restaurants without checking Yelp first because everyone else is dead on.  Avoid this place unless you're in the Strip and absolutely have to have some Vietnamese (and don't care too much about quality).
