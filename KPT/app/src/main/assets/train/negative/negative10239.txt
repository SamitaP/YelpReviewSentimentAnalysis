I love some BBQ but Sonny's just doesn't cut it for me. First of all this place is a franchise so that's automatically blasphemy in the BBQ world. I love some hometown BBQ & going into a place a franchised BBQ place just isn't on my list of favorite things to do.Their BBQ is good & you can order family style so everything here is not so bad. But there are plenty of other better hometown BBQ joints close by in Charlotte. Sonny's doesn't have anything that's spectacular but you'll leave full & satisfied.But for my money I'd rather get some better BBQ at a better price from a hometown place. If you don't mind the franchise feel added into your BBQ eating experience then you won't mind heading to Sonny's to get filled up. But for me you'll enjoy your BBQ much better from a local place with local recipes.
