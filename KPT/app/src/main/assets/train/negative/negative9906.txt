If you live nearby and are looking for a casual sports bar to watch games and drink beer Stool Pigeons is fair enough for just that. But beyond that total Meh. The food is not very special at all. It's mainly fried greasy traditional bar choices and the service can be good depending on which server or bartender you get. The customer service in general is not great and I've heard several people say this. As Anish said the bar is good for happy hour after work because you can literally drink and eat for super cheap. Each day they also have a $4.99 lunch special. Most people who eat here during lunch only order the lunch special.. so that should tell you something about the quality of the food there.They do have a lot of TV's and it still gets a decent crowd during football games... but it is definitely NOT what it  used to be back in the day. (Disclosure: I used to work here but this is still my honest opinion. I've held back some of my thoughts here actually.)Bonus: they have a TON of good beer on draft. It's probably about 20-25 beers on tap and they change quite often. If you catch them on a special draft night then SCORE if you're a beer lover!! They also have a fun little patio and it's prime location for people watching too.
