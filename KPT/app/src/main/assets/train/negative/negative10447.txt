I had high expectations for this place given that it came highly recommended by 2 work associates. Service was quick and attentive....even though I was the first to order and had to wait about 5 extra minutes AFTER everyone else got their order.....Strike 1.I got the Malay Sauce dish with chicken and shrimp. They give you LOTS of fried rice (or any rice you order) which makes the plate look deceivingly large but in reality it is NOT that big of a portion....whic is OK for lunch. But the chicken and shrimp portions were unusually SMALL (i.e. not that much of it) and they were definitely skimpy on the Malay Sauce. Strike 2.The flavors were.....somewhat BLAND. Not bad but compared to something like Hasaki Grill they just cannot compete. Strike 3.Not horrible but given the Uptown choices (Room 112 Hasaki Enzo etc.) there are FAR better choices than Fujo.
