I wasn't as impressed with Buca as I wanted to be. I'd always thought this place looked a little cheesy  from the outside but after years of business I finally decided to try it out with some friends who were celebrating a new job. Bread and drinks were promptly brought to the table along with a side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. We decided to start with the mixed green salad and added Gorgonzola and prosciutto on the side. Typically when I think of mixed greens I think of mesclun arugala frissae and other greens. Though I wouldn't expect these particular greens to be served in an Italian restaurant I don't understand why they considered this salad mixed greens. The only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage. I counted maybe five olives and three pepperoncinis. The prosciutto and Gorgonzola were plentiful though I'm not sure of the quality of prosciutto they use. It looked burnt and perhaps prepackaged like bacon bits. It was just okay as a whole. For our main dish we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni. This is where the experience failed in my mind as the chicken and peas did not taste fresh and the sauce was lacking in depth and flavor. It just wasn't as authentic as I was hoping for. Service was fine but I think I'll be skipping Buca next time I need a fix for Italian.
