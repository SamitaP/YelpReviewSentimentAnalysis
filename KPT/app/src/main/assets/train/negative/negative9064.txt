Sunday morning the cornbread hits the spot.  The rest of the meal food and service was mediocre at best. To tell the truth the service ran along the lines of pretty poor. We sat outside and the tables around us were annoyed with the bad service too. Actually the woman at the table of three directly across from us kept telling customers to go away when they came dine. She also was served the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her.We started the meal with the fried green tomatoes - Fresh green tomatoes battered in a herb and flour blend lightly fried to perfection and served with our own remoulade sauce - it was served with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plates but never did. She never refilled our drinks either. The fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them. It was hard to find tomatoes in the dish. I would resist trying this appetizer.We waited a long time for our main course which is why it was probably cold when it arrived at our table. Scott had the special beef tip omelet with potatoes. He had asked for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white. They never bought the toast or asked if his meal was good. I tried the Mert's famous salmon cakes. These were dry and cold and my sides the macaroni & cheese - tasty - and okra & tomatoes - greasy? - were also suffering from being left sitting waiting for someone to bring them to our table. After finally chasing someone down inside we got our check. With all the options in the neighborhood to try we probably won't add this to our list of great places to dine.
