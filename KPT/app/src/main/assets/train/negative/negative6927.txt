The owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience.  I arrived with my parents at 6pm just as it stated to get busy.  We submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins.  As tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations.  It was like we were invisible.  As the wait approached 40 min I went up to him and asked how many reservations there were and if he had any idea how much longer it would be.  He looked at me mumbled a sentence with the word ridiculous and said he didn't know.  I politely told him it wasn't a big deal and said he could remove our name from the list.  As we were leaving he came out the door and said we could sit outside (it was 50 degrees with a chance of rain).Only reason I'm leaving this review is because my mom was all worked up and felt disrespected.I just can't support business owners like this.  Go elsewhere.
