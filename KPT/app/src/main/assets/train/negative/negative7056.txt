Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch it needs to not only be good but also unique. Unfortunately Pamela's is neither of these things. Then again the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique try Coca Cafe.
