Good chinese takeout here seems to be hard to find.  This is the Hoho Cherry House.  The Hoho China Bistro is no more but I heard it moved here.The lunch specials are a good value but the food here is right about average.  General Tso's is OK.  This is more along the lines of a Panda Express but mom and pop owned.  For that I expected more.  Nothing to rave about but not terrible either.
