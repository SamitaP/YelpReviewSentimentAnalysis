It's a nice enough place with a decent selection of drinks (and a not-bad post-9pm happy hour) but I'd steer clear of the food.  If the portions were large and delicious the prices would be more than reasonable but sadly that's not the case.  I've never really enjoyed anything I've eaten here and the downright terrible burger is what prompted me to write the review warning folks away (medium rare came out well done and no one noticed or even asked how it was).So come here if you want to grab a drink with your friends on Walnut Street.  But I for one will be going someplace else first if I want dinner too.
