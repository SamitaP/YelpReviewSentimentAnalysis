I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville I have enjoyed it.  In light of that China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.The positives: The vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible either but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there I tried to go to Pamela's first but it was a Saturday afternoon so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.The negatives:Dim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic just dim.The only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5 even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60 because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.The food is only okay.  All in all if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here but it won't be memorable either.  I will probably return though for the cheap lunch specials but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can not because I really love the place.
