We went to this place also after seeing it on DDand D.This was after the smoking in places that serve food was put in place. We went with my sister and her not even toddler my two children and ... well we get to the location and almost turned around its just a bar Defiantly a dive! Took a while to get our food. The bar was loud and smokey! I orderd the perogies since that is why we went there. My son ordered a fish sandwich we orderd a childs spaggetti. some wings and some other things. The fish sandwich was HUGE. biggest i had ever seen.  The childs spaggetti was big and was shared with two children My son loved it .. i tasted it because i couldnt belive him. It was good! THE PEROIGES ----- BLAND~ soggy not crisp not buttery ... they were greasy. it tasted like bland mashed potatoes between unseasoned dough. We drove well over an hour to eat here. BIG mistake.
