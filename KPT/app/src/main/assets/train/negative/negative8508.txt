This review is of their Ri Ra Sandwhich shop around the corner since there is no separate listing for this shop. Stopped here because I've never been before so I ordered the old faithful Reuben. Pretty hard to screw up right? Well they managed to serve me a sandwhich that was barely eatable as the corned beef in it was like leather....very hard and chewy. The sandwhich was small. For $9 I'd expect a LOT more. The Rose Sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would expect. Not a very good sandwhich.Service was iffy at best. The young lady behind the counter was very nice and personable but the other two seemed like they didn't want to be there...aloof is the appropriate term.The ONLY saving grace were the Keogh's Dubliner Irish Cheese and Onion Potato Crisps imported from Ireland. If this place is going to rely on packaged potato chips to save them they won't be in business long.So a SMALL sandwhich chips and a 20oz bottle of diet coke set me back $14 with tip. That is a LOT for a LESS than adequate sandwhich. I will not be coming back.NOT recommended!
