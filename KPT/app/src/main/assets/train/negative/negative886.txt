The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be krab considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers no pork egg rolls no spareribs no won-ton soup.
