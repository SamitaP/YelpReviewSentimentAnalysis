This used to be our favorite place when we first moved to Pittsburgh two years ago.  It had good quality fish and a nice atmosphere/cool staff.  As of our last visit about two months ago the menu still had not changed the portions of fish were smaller while prices stayed the same and the atmosphere was on par with that of a Hofbrauhaus.  A drunken man knocked into our table on his way storming out of the restaurant which was immediately proceeded by the members of two different large tables rising from their chairs and yelling obscenities at each other.  It literally looked like there was going to be a brawl.  The members of these tables fairly quickly left the restaurant; however the staff and manager simply acted as if nothing had happened.  No one came by to see if things had spilled on our table which was run into.  It was absolutely not the experience we expected to have and it is a disappointment that this place has gone downhill.
