I was entirely underwhelmed by the supposed best burger in Pittsburgh as it had been recommended to me.  I guess I was expecting more flavor - some kind of house seasoning or something special but it was very ordinary.  It was quite busy and seemed a little cramped inside.  They seated us near the window facing LIberty which was great - but the way the seating was arranged my friend had her back to it.  I generally prefer  tables perpendicular to the window which allow everyone to look out occasionally without craning their neck.I'm hesitant to go back because the burger was the best-sounding thing on the menu and it wasn't that great.
