went there with my fiance and the food was not at all what i expected from the reviews.we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries. the bun was deflated and soggy. the burger meat itself looked promising but was burnt and vastly overcooked.. SAVE your money on the chili cheese fries. at $3.99 you get maybe two handfuls of their fries with two small spoons of unidentifiable meat (pork? beef?!) and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station. they do have their own radio station with great music and fun books to read while you wait. regrettably the food was just not what we were expecting and it is such a shame.
