I tried Pickles tonight for the first time.  I called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told 20 minutes.  I got there and was told it would be another 10.   It was another 20 before I got my food.  In a bad frame of mind I tried my food.  I must admit it was good.  Not great but good.  I didn't have an issue with the place or the other patrons.  I dig that kind of place.  But if you tell someone a time you should be able to deliver.  The food itself warrents a higher rating but the overall experience was a disappointment.
