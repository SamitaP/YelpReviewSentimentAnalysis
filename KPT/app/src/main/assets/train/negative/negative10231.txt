Pathetic no other way to describe this brunch.I did have breakfast here once before and it wasn't this bad. Feel my pain: .....I get there on Sunday at 1:30pm after the rush was over. Their house special Eggs Benny covers the whole front of the menu. I order that with a cup of black coffee. I get the coffee then my waitress disappears until 20 minutes later when she brings me my plate. I stop her from running off because the food looks suspicious. Sure enough the poached eggs were hard boiled. Is that too cooked for you? YES.I wait and I wait and I wait ( just a few customers in the house) and a whole 15 minutes later she quickly drops off the new plate and runs off NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. It's been 35 minutes since I first ordered. One egg is borderline ok the other is hard boiled again the Hollandaise is dry and starting to curdle the English muffins are not toasted properly and they're chewy as hell the hash browns are absolutely tasteless. Not a micro-gram of salt pepper paprika onions nothing to give it any flavor. No waitress anywhere not only mine but all the ladies wearing black tee-shirts are anywhere but in the dining room. After a few more minutes I lose patience go to the counter find a waitress and ask her for my check.The girl at the cash register asks me how was my meal and I tell her exactly how it went.... in detail. She is very very very sorry but doesn't offer to comp even the coffee. For maybe only the second or third time in my whole life I don't leave a tip. The worst Eggs Benny I've ever had coupled with ridiculously bad service: $15 and some change including a cup of coffee. That's right over FIFTEEN DOLLARS for this.edit: check out the review that was filtered I don't see why it was.  It reports a very similar experience to the one I had with the kitchen unable to cook the food right and the customer still being charged for it.
