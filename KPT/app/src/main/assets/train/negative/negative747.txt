This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand I wasn't expecting much so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words the food is perfectly edible here but boring and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair I only tried the pasta bread salad soup and calamari so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible although unlikely based on what I've seen.On the upside the service was friendly enough and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry you'll definitely be full when you leave.
