Disappointing ... I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was at best two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove IL in December was fabulous).When we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. It took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella tomato and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was we can't split this salad. Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. The main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - saut√©ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware Our drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad. I hope everyone inside had a better experience.
