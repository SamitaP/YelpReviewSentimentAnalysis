This place is awful.  The pizza is not good but what is worse is the people who run the place.  They screwed up my order and refused to fix it.  I told them I was going to throw it away and order from somewhere else.  And I did.  Its really too bad they are super close to my apartment. If they would've just been nice and switched it I'd probably order from them again just based on that alone.
