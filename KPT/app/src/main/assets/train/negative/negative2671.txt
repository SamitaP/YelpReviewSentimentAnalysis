Received bad service today.  Got the wrong chase for my sandwich  Got decaf tea instead of regular tea even though he was told black tea.  Usually you have to ask for decaf. However lots of seats since the place was empty.  We left Einstein's because it was  crowded.They Missed an opportunity to impress a new customer.  Guess it's back to Einstein's.
