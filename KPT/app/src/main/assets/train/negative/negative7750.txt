Where to begin my review as this will be my 1st and last review for this place.  I will definitely be sending a letter to the corporate office on this place. Upon entering for my families 1st time trying this spot for take out it would be our last.  I was in total shock seeing the cashier handling the register then placing lids on the tartar sauces used for the meals.  At no point was any washing of the hands or using gloves ever attempted mind you dealing with the register.  As my families meal was brought out I see a line cook stuffing his face with no gloves on just his bare hands.   I said to myself this is unsanitary practices being used here.  I then ask another worker to call the managers attention who's behind her and she gets into the deer mode acting as if who's the manager. I finally make eye contact with him as he knew I was right and went to the kitchen to possibly tell the guy stuffing his face you got caught.  The manager was looking all dirty himself too no name tag no indication that he's the manager.  I asked for a full refund I was not spending my money here.  I then ask for his name which he pulls out his a$$ and says it's Mr. Rapport.  Well that's the name I'll use when I compile a letter to the corporate office.  Please beware of this place save your money for a pack of bologna instead.
