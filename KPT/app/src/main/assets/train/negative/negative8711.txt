My girlfriend and I were part of a friend's birthday party of about 12 adults on a Thursday night. It was not especially crowded (no wait) and we had reservations.1. Nobody took our drink orders or brought us water for over 20minutes.2. When they brought out all the appetizers ours was not among them because it was never put in. When it finally came out it was clear the nachos were rushed and they were not especially good.3. When the entree came out we were brought the incorrect dish at this point I had more than enough of the place so I told them to forget about it and bring the check.4. Everyone had finished their meals for nearly an hour before the checks were sporadically brought out. After all the checks were brought out we had to pull the waitress aside and specifically ask for her to bring ours.5. During this whole time there was no one who looked like a manager to be found. Everyone at the table was clearly upset by the service yet management never showed its face.This was by far the worst dining experience I have ever been a part of and I would not recommend this overrated establishment to anyone.
