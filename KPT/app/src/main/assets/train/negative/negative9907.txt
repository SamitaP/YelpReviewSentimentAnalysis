Generic but what else do you expect from most downtown businesses. It's a sports bar for sure. Every meal comes with it's own built in wide-screen television tuned in to some sport where a a bunch of troglodytes go up against another bunch of neanderthals. Service was nice the place was fairly empty. The décor was interesting. I liked the low lighting and the fans over the bar.Pet Peeve... our waitress didn't know shit about the craft beer she was serving us. This is what knocked the 3rd star off.They have a decent beer selection but you better know your stuff cause asking the waitstaff about their beer selectionwill just get you an umm... err... we have bud bud light coors light and miller light on special.Went with a couple of friends. I saw something called Tatchos in their appetizer section. I ordered it as it sounded like the most insanely unhealthy thing I could eat. It certainly was. The appetizer portion could definitely feed half the population of Peru. I can't even imagine what the full entrée size must be! They were ok. Nachos with Tator Tots is what I got.Overall not a bad experience. Not the type of place I'd plan to go but if my friends who live right around the corner drag me there again it'd be fine.
