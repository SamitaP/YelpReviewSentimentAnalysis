After hearing good things about Blue Restaurant and Bar Denise and I were happy to try it out last night.  To be fair we knew it was pricey.  So we were happy to give it a go considering that someone else was picking up the tab!In any case wanting to try something unusual that I can't get anywhere else I chose the Wild Boar.  Four slices of tenderloin and a small chunk of shoulder served atop a bed of spinach which in turn was on top of some sort of risotto (rice-like) mixture and the whole shebang was highlighted with berries (huckleberries I think).The tenderloin was average.  Good but a smallish portion and nothing really special about it.  The shoulder was excellent and rivaled a tender pot roast.  The risotto was good as was the berry that highlighted the plate.  The spinach just looked nasty (and I _like_ spinach) so I didn't try it.Beverage service was excellent.  Rarely did I drink more than a bit from my water glass before it was refilled to the top.  Same with my ginger ale.  Bar service appeared to be pretty speedy as well.  But food service was horrid.  Slow slow slow.Several of the people in our party ordered a chocolate cake dessert at the time they ordered dinner - apparently it takes a while to prepare.  Well our server didn't really seem to notice that other people at the table might want some dessert and was almost shocked when two of us asked for dessert menus when the cakes started arriving.An order of ice cream and another of berries went completely unserved though we waited twenty minutes or so for them.  I understand if one of the little cakes was ordered it might take a while to cook.  But how long does it take to scoop some ice cream and throw some berries on a plate?I doubt we'll be back but it isn't completely about the service.  The food just wasn't that great and it was a bit pricey.  Nothing wrong with paying up for great food but Blue wasn't it.
