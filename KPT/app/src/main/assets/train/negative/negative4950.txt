I'm Vietnamese and I grew up eating Vietnamese food everyday.  Let me tell you this place is a big let down.  I don't know why people are giving it such rave reviews.  All my Viet friends in this city also avoid this place because it really is NOT good.  The portions are tiny and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied.  It lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have.  I've had pho at home and in 30+ different pho restaurants and this was probably in my top 5 most disappointing.  As for the other dishes it comes to the table looking like someone already ate it or like a jumbled mess.This is aside from the service..I actually like the old man that works there...he's the only reason I give it two stars.
