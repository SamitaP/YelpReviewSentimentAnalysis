Four star food three star service and two star ambience.Went in got the stink-eye from two or three folks sitting at the bar watching the hockey game.  Sat in the dining room and it was spooky quiet; for the first half of our meal no one else was there there wasn't music and the only other sounds came from the next room which just felt odd.  Atmosphere was bad.Got the pasta roll which was absolutely delicious; awesome pasta/pine nuts/spinach under a relatively light red cream sauce.  The salad I had was lackluster though; wilted greens dry shredded carrots and a pepperoncini that was just off; it tasted bitter which was an all-new all-bad taste for those.  Ew.  Five star entree two star salad maybe.There were two waitresses and only two tables; refills on water were pretty quick up front (several times) but we wound up hanging out for five or ten minutes after we were done eating before seeing our waitress again.Two and a half stars?  I'd stop in and get a pasta roll for take-out maybe but there's a lot of competition for selling red-sauce italian food in the Italian neighborhood ya know?
