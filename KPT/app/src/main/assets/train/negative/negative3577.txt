Usually I really like this place.  Stopped in after not eating all day and ordered the famous lobster roll.  It took 40  minutes to receive a medium piece of lobster claw on thick Mancino toast.  THATS IT!  Oh and less than stellar fries with a cup of cole slaw.  I waited with an empty pint glass several times as well...I guess you can't get it right every time.
