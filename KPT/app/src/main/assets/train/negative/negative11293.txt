My fiance and I went to Cajun Queen one night as a date night.  I was not impressed by the food nor the ambiance.  We booked a late night dinner due to his schedule  and when we arrived the jazz band was already on break.  We were seated but our waitress appeared to not to want to be there.  I ordered the New Orleans ice tea and my fiance ordered sweet tea it took a while before the drinks were delivered and let me tell you - It wasn't nothing to brag about.  The food was spicy not flavorful just spicy.  Even the couple beside us was a little perplexed about it just being spicy (a little eavesdropping).  Needless to say not a great experience.  So fortunate that I was able to get a group-on discount and not pay for a $70 experience that I didn't enjoy.  I wouldn't return or recommend this place.
