I'm not one for ordering out at work with coworkers very often and this experience can probably tell you why.Boston Market has this nifty gadget on their website that allows you to order via the Internet the order is sent to the store that you select and you just go and pick it up.  Humph that's where the happiness stops.  Just because you send your order in and are given a time for pick up does not mean that your order will be ready.  Also be sure to print out your invoice prior to going or they will literally argue with you that you order is complete.  Out of five orders only two were done correctly.  So that meant the estimated twenty minutes on the invoice actually turned into about 45 minutes.  Would have been easier to drive here walk into the store and wait for the order to be done.And prices weren't really that great.  Food not as good either the meatloaf I ordered has several pieces of gristle in it.  And if I hadn't asked for gravy to put on it it would have been dry beyond believe.As the stars say Meh.  I've experienced better.
