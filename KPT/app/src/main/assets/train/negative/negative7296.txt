While it has a somewhat trendy looking menu don't be fooled. We ordered the calamari mexican pizza ahi tuna and french onion soup. While the onion soup was actually good the rest was awful.The mexican pizza was greasy and looks like it was reheated in a microwave it tasted like cardboard and looked even worse. The calamari was awful came with a gross looking/tasting dip. The ahi tuna was actually just mediocre which was a nice improvement from the rest of the meal. If i was a bigger jerk I would have demanded they take the food back but I just had a bite of everything and asked the waitress to take it back.I would never eat here again
