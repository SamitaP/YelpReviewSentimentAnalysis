It was a beautiful day in Pittsburgh today - I had to get outside for a walk in the sunshine.  I thought I'd just wander around for Thai lunch and so I ended up at Lemon Grass.  I'll probably not be back.There was just one table of 2 seated and eating when I arrived.  And a table of 10 leaving and all paying separately.  All using a credit card.  I forgot to mention that the one waitress working is also the cashier.  So it took quite a while to process this table's payments individually by card.  In moments like these it's best to just get the one check for the whole table and take the 18% auto gratuity as a courtesy to the server.  (Sorry for the rant there...)All that said the huge table of 10 had left.  I was dining alone and there was just the other table of 2 in the restaurant.  I thought I would be able to get in and get out for lunch.  But no such luck.  It took a while for the server to take my order.  The food came out quickly enough.  But it was quite underwhelming.  I settled with the Thai Fried Rice with beef.  There was a ton of Thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming.  I couldn't be sure if the basil was fresh which may be why the dish tasted a bit rancid to me.  My entree also came with a choice of soup and a small vegetarian egg roll.  I chose the hot and sour soup.  The soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour.I was a bit surprised considering that there were a whopping 3 diners in the restaurant that it took a while for the check to arrive and to get drink refills.  I had high hopes for this place but the food and service was just so disappointing.  The hunt continues for decent Asian food near my office in the Allegheny Center...
