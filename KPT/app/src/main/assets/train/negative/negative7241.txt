People who reviewed this place as being GOOD... obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds).Came here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in. Wanted to go to Pamela's but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to China Palace. I was REALLY wary because I did a quick Yelp search before we walked in but my dad insisted that it was probably not that bad.Here's what we ordered:- Cheese wontons (Um... they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons. Who does that?! It's supposed to be CREAM CHEESE!! And they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in.)- Chicken Lo Mein- Beef Lo Mein- Shrimp and Broccoli w/ Sweet and Sour Soup (The soup was the most disgusting texture of I-don't-know-what. Needless to say that was left untouched.)Let's just say not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout) the food itself was just utterly disappointing... A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine. It was bland yet greasy and MSG-ridden (if that makes any sense). Not only that they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok so whoever claims this restaurant serves authentic Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about). And the kicker? It came out to about $32 + tip for food that we DIDN'T even finish half of. We literally just got up mid-meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of rice.DO NOT GO HERE!!! ... unless you're a snake that is.
