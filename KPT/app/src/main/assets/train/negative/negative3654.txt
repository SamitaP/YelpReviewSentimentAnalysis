This is the first time in a long while (10 yrs?) and now I remember why. The food is fair at best for the main meal. The salad is good but small. The hummus is a little bland. The best parts were the homemade wine both white and red kinda like adult kool-aid  and the Jackie O cake was great. My issue was the price $59. for dinner for 2. For this price I would have expected more.I can't believe the 4 and 5 star reviews that I have read on this site. It's hard to believe that this place rates so many opposing reviews. I will never go back here again.
