This bar is cramped overpriced and the service is unbelievably slow. Happy Hour runs 4-6 so you'll show up at 5 have no place to sit or stand and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours You'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5 even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times I've been there).Seriously avoid this place. When one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour direct them anywhere else.
