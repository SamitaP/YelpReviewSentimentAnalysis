I had my second bowl of pho in Pittsburgh here and although it was better than my first bowl it was still pretty disappointing.  The broth is everything for pho.  Pho broth takes like nine hours to make.  The broth at Pho Minh is bland and almost clear in color.  Good broth should be dark and pungent not like watered down chicken broth.  I had the combination beef with tripe pho and there was literally about five small pieces of beef in there.  I guess since there is not much competition here for Vietnamese food the $8 price tag is valid even though that's much more than what I normally pay for good pho elsewhere.We also ordered the deep fried spring rolls and that was a disappointment too.  Mine was also still cold in the center so I can only guess that they are frozen beforehand.
