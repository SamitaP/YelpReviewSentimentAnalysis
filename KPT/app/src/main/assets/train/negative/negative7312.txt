This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK it was thawed but had previously been frozen) corn about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta. As a vegetarian this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal. What a disappointment - I won't be back.
