I really want to love this restaurant but I really don't. I have tried it at the lunch buffet and I recently ordered rice samosas and naan to accompany Indian food I was cooking at home. Sadly both experiences were less than stellar. Bland doesn't begin to describe the food. Absolutely no taste. When I want to eat Indian food I want to eat Indian food - not tasteless spiceless food. Did my Irish name cause my order to be overly Americanized?? :-) Even my little children were totally unimpressed. I am pretty sure we will not be giving this restaurant a third try.
