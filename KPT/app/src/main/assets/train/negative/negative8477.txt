Came here with a friend for lunch and sat on the roof top deck. Aces for that! We started with the fried pickle. Love FP but these were a poor representation of them. Greasy and the batter was peeling off. I had the brisket with sweet potato oh! That's right. I didn't get what I ordered. I over cooked greasy fries like everyone else. The brisket was very good thought. It had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it. The meat was a bit over cooked. It was a beautiful day to hand with friends on the sunny deck!
