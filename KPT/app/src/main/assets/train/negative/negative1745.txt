I have a dream. A dream that some day the North Shore will have a ton of amazing food options. I hope one day it will become a reality. For now I think there's a smattering of okay-ish places and a lot of mediocrity. Maybe it's just the built in crowd. You come to a game you gotta eat right? And what are you going to eat? Either at a restaurant outside the stadium or inside. At this point I'd stick with inside for the novelty of it all. I stopped into Atria's on game day but came in right as the first pitch was going out so it wasn't packed in the least. Our server was obviously not into us as well as serving that day as she was pretty short with us the entire time. Sorry we bothered you...The menu is incredibly limited with around 5 apps 5 sandwiches and 5 main courses. I get that they're probably just limiting things for the crowded times but I felt like nothing really called to me. I settled on going halfies and ordering an app and waiting until I was inside the stadium to get my main course. Crab fries naturally. But that's beside the point.The pieorgies we ordered were okay. They were doused in Parmesan cheese and a little overcooked but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had. Wasn't the best either. I think what really turned me off was the whole experience. Service small selection and mediocre food. I should have just ordered two buckets of crab fries and called it a night!
