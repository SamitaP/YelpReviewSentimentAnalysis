There's a reason why this place has no reviews.  It's never open...not even at 6:30 pm on a Thursday.  Even though the sign said Open and the door was open.  I guess I was supposed to know that it was closed.  But all I got was two people screaming in my ear that it was closed like I barely understood or something.  So much for customer service.  Needless to say I probably won't be back.
