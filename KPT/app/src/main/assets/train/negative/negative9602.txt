This place is quite a paradox....You almost have to love to hate it...Why do I say this?The FOOD is terrible....The bread is soggy the sandwiches uneventful..the burgers bland...and the fries are pedestrian...The amenties are average picnic tables w/bad wood booths...THe prices are high for what you get...So why would you LOVE it?They have some INCREDIBLY hot girls who work there...My high school friend who's still a bachelor would LOVEthis place.  These girls are all his cup of tea.ALL of the girls are young wispy curvy and pretty...Probably 5'1-5'5 walking around in form fitting outfitsw/long straight hair...and perfectly tanned faces w/incrediblefeatures.Not just ONE..but ALL of them are like that.Is this where the girls who didn't make the Carolina Panther cheerleader squad work?  At least they must be the little sisters of the panther cheerleaders.YOu will see LOTS of pervy looking silver haired men in this place..pretending like they like the food..It's too bad the girls have no idea how to be servers..I ordered a roast beef sandwich but instead of getting what I want..I was forced to get what the girl wanted me to order...it was like a jedi mind trick!Me I'd like a cold roast beef w/some dip on the sideHer So you want the au jou...(scolding me)ME Um..not really..I wanted the vegetables on the cold sandwichHer You can get that but it's still an au jouME Okay...I guess?Her Yes..so you are getting the au jouSO she gives me the roast beef Au Jou and of courseI got no lettuce tomatoes etc as I requested.I didn't even want to bother to correct her..I could tell it wasn't getting through.Just stand there honey..in your skin tight leggings ugg bootsand form fitted sweater and smile.That's why guys spend 10-20 dollars in here.At least this isn't frowned upon like it is in California and is actually CELEBRATED here in Charlotte.Pretty girl who can't do much..serving you bad food!
