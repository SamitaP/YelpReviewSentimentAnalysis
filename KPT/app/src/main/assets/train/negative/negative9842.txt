I had never been to CG and decided to indulge myself a little while out of town on business. After a brief conversation with a foodie friend I was directed to CG over Ruths Chris for a good steak experience. Food: 1 Star For fancy steakhouses I only have Flemings and Mortons to compare to. I also have the wise words of my father who always told me that only poorly cooked steaks need steak sauce. I've been to Flemings several times and every time it's always come seasoned perfectly. At Capital Grille in Charlotte to my surprise and disappointment I got a $60 bill and an unseasoned tasteless steak to show for it. I did order some bleu cheese crumbles to go with it but it didn't mix well either. I ended up using the bleu for my mashed potatoes which made those a total hit! But to goto a fancy shmancy steakhouse where you (or your company) is charged an arm and a leg and they can't even properly cook your steak for you is just criminal. I am assuming my problem was remote and hopefully only a local problem but it left a bad taste in my mouth for the next time I goto a nice steakhouse. Service: 4 Star Service was great but obviously who cares if you get crap at your plate?
