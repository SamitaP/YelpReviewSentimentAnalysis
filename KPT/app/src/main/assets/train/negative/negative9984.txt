Although Arthur's offers a good variety of options the service and execution and wait time has diminished the last few times I was there. I ordered a six inch turkey hoagie with chips and a drink $12.00 ugh! The sandwich was brought with no tomatoes and lettuce and they forgot to add the onions I requested. The bread was stale and after waiting 20 minutes I was definitely disappointed.
