This place is going downhill fast. I went for the infamous bacon night this past Tuesday and wow - it sucked. First off our waitress just wasn't good. She forgot to put our order for a basket of bacon in and we had to ask for it thirty five mins later. Bacon doesn't take that long to cook. Then we had to ask for ranch with our wings - which we'd already requested but she'd brought us bleu cheese instead. Oh AND they were out of bacon wings! On bacon night! WTF. Anyways we also had to request sour cream for the pierogies which is normally brought out with them plates (b/c we were sharing several appetizers) and ketchup. Why ketchup? Let me tell you. We'd ordered the sliders as well and it was the saddest display of baby burgers I've ever seen. They were brought out on one of the same small plates that we had for sharing our apps - like the size of a saucer that you'd put a tea cup on. And there were only TWO of them. Two! For six bucks I'll go get six non-mini burgers at freaking mcdonalds. And to top it off they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING. I got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order and they were served on a fanciful long plate with a selection of condiments - you know ketchup tomato onion mustard etc. Normal things that people put on burgers every day. So that was really disappointing. But it wasn't over.The bacon baskets arrived. The simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there right? Nope. There were literally exactly four sad little pieces. The big basket only made 'em look all the sadder. And they'd somehow managed to burn half of each slice black while the other half was rubbery and undercooked. Yuck. Overall I would never go back again if it wasn't for the fact that I have a gift certificate. The only things Harris has going for it right now are its patios cleverly written menu and nice location on Ellsworth ave. Oh and a lot of condescending d-bags if you're into that kinda thing.
