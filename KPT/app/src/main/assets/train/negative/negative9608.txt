This was stop #4 on our night uptown/downtown.  I paid $8 for small plastic cups of John Daly which is ridiculous.  However my friend bought a blue Panthers shot and they gave me a free one because they said I had to drink one too which was nice. It was all right but I could have spent the entire night at BlackFinn instead!
