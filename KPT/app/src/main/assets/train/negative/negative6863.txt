I've been to girasole many times and have loved the food. The reason for the low marking is because of the service the last time I visited.It was over the holidays and my family was in town. Since we were a party of 5 I called the day before to make reservations for 8pm on a Wednesday. We got to the restaurant prior to our reservation time and they said it would be half an hour. We are easy goin people so we didn't mid waiting.The owner instructed us to go to the bar next door and have a drink. After 45 min I went back to the restaurant since they hadn't called us yet and he instructed us to go back to the bar.Finally after waiting an hour and a half they finally sat us. This bothered me for two reasons. 1. The people who got say before us did not have reservations walked in after us but knew the owner. Very poor form on the owners part. 2. He said we would be taken care of. I was thinking maybe an appetizer or wine something for promising us a table with reservations and then having us wait for over an hour. But when the bill came there was none of that.We still had a good time since the company was good but it will be a long time before I go back to this restaurant.
