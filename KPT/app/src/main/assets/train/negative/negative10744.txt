I went here for dinner on a Friday night. The place was empty and only one group walked in after me and my fiance. Oddly enough the host sat them right next us and the tables are very close.So the waiter brings out the papaadam. One side is burnt and they only offer one dipping sauce. Then the waiter brings my wine and forgets my fiance's beer. He then brings out our entree's: mushroom mutter and lamb korma.We ordered both entree's spicy and the mushroom mutter was very bland. The lamb korma had a sour tangy taste to it. The entree's were not horrible but I would much rather go to Jaipur. The naan is another story. It tastes like the freezer version you can get from Trader Joe's.
