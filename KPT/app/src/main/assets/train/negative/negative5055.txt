I came here awhile ago and ordered one of the rice-based dishes with chicken (can't remember exactly what it was and there's no menu posted online for me to figure it out).  The dish was dry and lacked flavor.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish here since the Pho seems to be what they're known for.  As it were I wasn't impressed. I don't remember anything being off about the service so it must have been fine.  If a dining partner specifically wanted to try Vietnamese I'd come back and try the Pho but otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here given that there are many better dining options on Butler St.
