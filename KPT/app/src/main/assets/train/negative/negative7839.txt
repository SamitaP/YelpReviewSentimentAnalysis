The meal was Filet with asparagus and salad though right now I am not eating oil of any kind so the salad was not an option - I opted for the grilled shrimp instead ... Steak was delicious - the asparagus was cooked to death and worn out and the grilled shrimp was good though the manager wanted no part of offering any consideration of discount for the salad I didn't order ... Long story short - go to Outback Steakhouse right around the corner and get treated remarkable and get food you want with no hassles mate ! Won't make this mistake again - too many choices in Charlotte to have to dicker over $6.00 !  Outback would not only have accommodated my request but would have checked to make sure I was happy ... Longhorn was NOT crowded - hum. ... Probably why ... Carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !
