Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon that we had purchased specifically for Fujo. They refused to take it and the manager told us you have two choices ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it. If we had been rude then I wouldn't be able to blame him but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it. We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food.
