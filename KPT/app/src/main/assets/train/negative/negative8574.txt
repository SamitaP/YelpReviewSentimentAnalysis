We stayed at the Holiday Inn Center City for a trip and happened to visit Soho Bistro for dinner on a rainy evening. The restaurant is clean well laid out and appealing. The staff was exceptionally friendly and our waiter was a young man who was very eager to please. Unfortunately the food was sub-par. The egg roll and scallion pancakes were hot and tasty but our entrees were disappointing. I ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp. This wouldn't have been a big deal but I have a shellfish allergy. They corrected the error but when the chicken was served it was burned and it was clear that the veggie garnishes were transferred from one plate to the other. My dinner companion ordered noodles which he described as tasting like watered down spaghetti with weak curry sauce. I can't stress how nice the people were but the food portion could use a visit from Kitchen Nightmares.
