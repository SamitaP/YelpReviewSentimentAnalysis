Took clients to dinner on a week night on what appeared to be a slow time. We were placed into a very crowded part of the restaurant. (empty tables elsewhere) Waiter was fair at best and he seemed in a hurry through out the meal. Food was nothing more than average which was a surprise after the high rating I read about. Unfortunately this was not just my opinion but the opinion of all 6 people in our party. I was ready to write it off to a just a bad night when a colleague mentioned that his lunch the previous day was similar. The entire experience was certainly below my expectations.
