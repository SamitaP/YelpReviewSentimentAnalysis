I stopped by the Chicken Box to grab lunch today.  I hadn't been there for a long time and I was really excited about getting some of their fried chicken mac & cheese and collard greens.  When I pulled into the parking lot I noticed a big sign hanging down from the roof proclaiming that the original owners were back and it was under new management.  I hate to say it but the original owners have really messed up a good thing.  When I went inside the huge menu board that listed all the amazing soul food side dishes were gone.  I guess the new management is trying to just rip off Price's by having the only side dish be mediocre coleslaw and bad tater tots.  The real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe.  Does anyone know where the old managers went?  I need more of there home cooking.  This new chicken box cafe is terrible.
