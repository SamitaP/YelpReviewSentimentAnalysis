Read reviews and beg to differ. Had to argue with staff that a martini does not only have two ounces! The glass was literally less than half full. For 11 dollars a glass! Rob was the bartender.When we complained twice the glass got filed. Corn bread was like cardboard. Mussels very good. Trout very good. No doubt they have a good chef. However the management is very lacking. Manager came over right when ewe we got our entrees and we asked her to come back and she never did. The bussing was a joke. We had to put our appetizer plates on the next table because they  were never cleared. Not a pleasant meal.Not worth the money.
