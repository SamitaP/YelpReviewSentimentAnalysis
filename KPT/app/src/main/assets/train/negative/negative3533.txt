If 0 stars were possible I'd give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill. I didn't even touch the anemic yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.Speaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit but you follow me.This guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??! Worst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest. I'd suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there!
