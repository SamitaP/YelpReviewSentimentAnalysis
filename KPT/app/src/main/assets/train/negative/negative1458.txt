The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.This time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the get together than the food/location.This time overpriced food and bad service.  Overall it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.I am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. I am NOT interested in ever going back!
