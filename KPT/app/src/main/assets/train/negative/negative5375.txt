Went for a second time on a busy Friday night and had a 45 minute wait for a table.  The wait was not unexpected so we expected to order drinks and pass the time.  However the bar tenders were very unenthusiastic about serving drinks to us.  The two bar tenders made us feel like we were putting them out.  While waiting we were told to stand in the rear coat rack area.  There are about ten wooden posts for coats and above those posts is a rail with an inch thick line of dust.The dust doesn't end there.We were sat at a booth at the front of the place under a ceiling fan and under an old phone.  The phone above us on the wall is covered in cobwebs and dust.  Each of the ceiling fan blades is covered in dust and that dust and dirt is so thick it is dripping off the sides just waiting to fall in our plates.  The food:  average.   Most of us had burgers.  One of us had the open face steak sandwich.  The steak was over charred and under seasoned.  One of us felt the same about one of the burgers.6 of us plus drinks was $160.00. This place needs to be closed for a few days of deep cleaning.  If they don't care about the cleanliness of the dining room they surely don't care about safe food prep.
