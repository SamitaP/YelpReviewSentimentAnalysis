I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha.
