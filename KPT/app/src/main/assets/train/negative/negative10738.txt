Though I'm a Copper enthusiast when it comes to getting my Indian fix in Charlotte I'd heard that Maharani was a cheaper but tasty option so we ordered from there a few nights ago. Copper is definitely still my place but Maharani was fine enough. First of all the food came very quickly which is rare. Usually indian food good indian good takes at least 30-45 minutes. We got our order in like 30 which was great 'cause we were starving. The Tikka Masala was spicy and pretty good but it wasn't as thick and saucy as i like. The salad was just so-so. The Naan were all amazing. Definitely the highlight.
