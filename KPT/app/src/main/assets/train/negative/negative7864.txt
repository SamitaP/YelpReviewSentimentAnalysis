I was very unimpressed with this Olive Garden location.  The service was subpar- I sat at the bar and the bartender was far more interested in talking to coworkers than the few patrons at the bar.Secondly the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company. The Zuppa Toscana was devoid of the spiciness that makes the soup as well as full of fatty sausage.I also ordered the Ravioli di Portobello it came out stone cold unacceptable for a baked entree. I sent it back and the second time it came out it was just as cold. I finally spoke to a manager who comp'd my meal. I will never be back to this location.
