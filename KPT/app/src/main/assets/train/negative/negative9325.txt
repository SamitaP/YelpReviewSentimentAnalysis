i'm from california and did extensive research on food in the downtown area even though i was only going to be here for a day. this place got good reviews so i snuck in for happy hour before heading to the king's kitchen for dinner. basically the only drinks on happy hour menu were a madras for $5 and miller lite for $3. um not so cool. then i ordered the popcorn shrimp for an app. it looked delish when it came out. i even ate a couple and the sauces were yummy. even the people aitting next to me commented on how yummy it looked. then i saw a line of poop in one of the shrimp. a super gross out peeve of mine. i started to go through all the shrimp and they all had the poop. serving un-de-veined shrimp at such a fancy place?? uck!! i stopped eating. and left. will not return. BUT service was good.
