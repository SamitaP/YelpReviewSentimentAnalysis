Food was ok. It wasn't bad just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember
