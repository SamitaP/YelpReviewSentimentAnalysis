I'm simply not a fan of this place and don't plan on going back so let me explain why... Last fall before a panthers game I came here and had a pretty decent lunch-I had a tasty buffalo chicken wrap with fries and two Bloody Mary's (yes it was one of those Sundays) and all was good. I left for the game with a decent memory of Presto. Fast forward to the new owners and disappointed is the best word that comes to mind. First I met a co-worker for a quick lunch which meant I wasn't hungover or imbibing so it was a much more objective assessment. I paged through a menu that has a serious identity crisis from mediterranean to American to italian pasta dishes to typical bar food and settled on a chicken gyro sandwich...when in doubt I always go the specialty cuisine. When it arrived it had tzatziki on the side (good) and some weird greasy dressing drizzled inside (not good). To make things worse after my first taste I almost sent it back to say I ordered chicken thinking they gave me fish...but them realized the consistency was chicken with a really bad taste. Nonetheless I ate the pita bread and wilted greens I got for a side salad and split...with a stomach ache to follow.  I really try to give places more than one try before writing a bad review but you couldn't pay me to go back for another try
