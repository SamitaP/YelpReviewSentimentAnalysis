My boyfriend and I have been to Ho Ho Cherry House a couple times because its right up the street from our house. On a recent visit to pick up our order I happened to notice there was a coupon in their to go menu I had picked up.  The coupon was spend 15 get 5 off. I asked the MANAGER hey can we please use this coupon?  The manager said did you just pick that up off my counter? Playfully I said umm noooo thinking there was no way he was going to deny us the coupon.. (remember talking to the manager not a teenager in the front.)  He then proceeded to tell us that no we couldn't use the coupon and we would have to take the coupon home cut it and use it on our next visit. I said I couldn't believe that and that if there was some sort of parameter of that sense it should be clearly stated on the to-go menu. When he finally refused I said under my breath guess we'll be going down the street to 88 Bistro. to which he had the nerve to reply yeah I heard that place is great have you been? What a jackass. If directly disrespecting your customers is how you run your business then I will be happy to support your competitor.
