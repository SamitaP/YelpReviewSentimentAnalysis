Staff was very friendly. But food and drinks were disappointing. This place markets itself as Martini specialists but I had to ask for my martini to be remade a second time as it came without olives. Also - olives were standard jarred fair. A much better martini can be had at Urban Sip above the Ritz - they have Spanish giant olives hand-stuffed with blue cheese.
