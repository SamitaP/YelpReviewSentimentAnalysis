Second time may be a charm but the first time was a complete failure. Thank you to management Veronica in particular for making a bad experience and almost the last experience one worth trying again. Salmon patties were very dry and not seasoned as described potato salad or should we say mayonnaise salad was horrible. The yams were hard as if they were freshly cut and simply plated. The greens were soaked in garlic and had entirely too many stalks. The macaroni and cheese was tasty but in conjunction with everything else on our plates was room temperature. Tiger wood drinks were very tasty. Our server was not at all attentive to our needs. If she would have given us her name I would have very well called her out in this review. She did refill our drinks once and left the remaining glasses of lemonade and sweet tea on the table which implied.....self serve. My fiance absolutely loved the cornbread loaves and fried whiting. I detested the cornbread loaves. The initial one that I received had obviously been sitting out too long. It was cold. When I mentioned it to the waitress she informed me that she knew the loaves were left out and that a new batch would be up any minute. She did bring a fresh loaf but I was just flabbergasted that she would serve something she new shouldn't have been served. Overall the experience was not very pleasing. However our entire meal was comped by Veronica. She apologized for the service and invited us to come back. I must admit I am a little reluctant but because she heard our concerns we will give Mert's another try. I see their are multiple good reviews on here and hated to have to be the one to add a negative review. However this was our experience.
