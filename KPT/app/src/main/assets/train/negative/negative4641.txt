The restaurant operates out of a renovated brothel...my brother and I dined at the bar...which had various house infused liquors...(maple whiskey...peppercorn vodka...cherry vodka...pickled gin... Dirty vodka..others)..we ordered the buffalo chicken medallions for appetizer...which were at best average ...my top shelf long island was average....food delivery was slow and the bartender was occupied for a whoke before taking our order...the bathrooms are dated....it seems like this restaurant is catered to 50+...the dining hall was not busy but our appetizer took nearly 20 minutes to come out and our entree over 30 minutes..my snapper was average on a bed of collard greens.  ..whipped sweet potatoes average again and creamed kake was definitely average.  ..the host brought out complimentary marinated mushrooms which were pretty good after our dinner...our dessert was chocolate cake a la mode..which was a cold cake with a small scoop of strawberry ice cream on the side.  The chocolate cake again at best average...the bill came to 90 with my brother ordering the cod and a beer. I had a Bailey's on ice which was probably the best thing I ordered...
