Avoid this place.  Food was decent but a lot of it was cold and did not taste fresh.  I tried the crab legs on the buffet and as soon as I cracked them an ammonia smell was present.  They had a lot of American dishes on the buffet as well over salted and overall not that good.  The other food was decent but as I said before was cold.  However the sushi was decent not the quality you expect at an actual sushi restaurant.  But the guy making made me a custom roll and was very nice about it.  However if you do come just get the sushi it's worth the price and just avoid the buffet.
