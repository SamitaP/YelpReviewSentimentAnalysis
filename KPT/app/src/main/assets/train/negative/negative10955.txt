I ordered a pizza at 10:25 just one pepperoni pizza nothing fancy and I did not get the pizza until 11:50. They sent me an email confirmation saying it would be 30-40 minutes which obviously wasn't the case. When I called to inquire after an hour they simply said it was on it's way no offer for a coupon or a comp pizza or anything. After taking one bite I'm less than satisfied. It's cold and completely unimpressive. To top it off when I had to sign my credit card receipt the delivery person asked me if thy could have my pen bc they left there's at home. I will never order from them again. There are far too many BETTER pizza places to indulge in.
