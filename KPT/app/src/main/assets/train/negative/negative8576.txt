I've been going to this place for a few years now and every time I go it loses another star and another chance. It used to be the best place to get Chinese food but recently it has gotten really gross. Today was the last straw. I got the Steamed Chicken Dumplings and a order of Edamame to go. The dumplings had no taste other than salt  the dough was so think and chewy I didn't eat my last two. The worst part were the soy beans. Half of them rotten no salt no seasonings just plan nasty and I tossed about half of the order. Come on guys I know you can do better!
