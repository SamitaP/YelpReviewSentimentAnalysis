Looking at all the other reviews about this place I wondered if we actually went to the same place.  I thought it wasn't very good.  I had the Eggplant Alexander which consisted of a bunch of soggy fried eggplant with a ton of cheese melted on it.  I've made much better at home.  My beloved had veal Parmesan.   Which was dry overcooked and lukewarm.  Did we catch them on a bad day?  I'll never know because I don't think we'll return.
