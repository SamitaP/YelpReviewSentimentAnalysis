I live off of Liberty Ave and everyone kept telling me I needed to try this place so after 4 months I did.  When my wife and I walked in I thought this place doesn't look too bad actually kinda cool.  WRONG!  After being seated it probably took 5 minutes for the waitress to come over and another 5 minutes for our coffee to get to the table.  Our food took about 45 minutes which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast but I though everyone thinks this place is great I guess I can wait for perfection. The food gets to our table it looks good it looks like breakfast but it is cold well mine was cold.  So I'm sitting at the table empty coffee cold breakfast and quite pissed off because of the situation and I'm hungry.  Finally after about 10-12 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is I tell her my food is cold and I'm fine and don't need another plate we had already been there over an hour we had placed to go ya know.When the waitress brings the bill over she doesn't just tell me she took my food off she says I figured I would take the food off even though you didn't ask (really?  should I have to?).Wife's food was hot but she thought it to be just average breakfast.I never want to go back but I will because I always give places another shot.Terribly slow service (server was very nice though probably home from college) and food took forever.  I doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis because this place wouldn't be so packed and highly regarded.
