Visited for lunch on the weekend. This place maybe good for game watching in the evenings but I do not think they are equipped for much else. I sat in a booth in the bar area and you could see they hadn't cleaned the walls in or near the booth in quite some time because of the old dried up food on the wall. Also the bathrooms where in bad shape.Service: Slow and I'm not sure we where the servers to priority because there were not many other people in the place and we had to wait for everything.Not a good experience for us.
