Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited but hell it was going to be free! Got to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!After waiting for about 5 a girl came up and asked how many in our party. I responded two of us but is there a wait?? She responds yes at least 10-15 minutes.At this point I look around the restaurant way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant but customer service and perception is always #1. Needless to say I walked out before we were seated fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business.
