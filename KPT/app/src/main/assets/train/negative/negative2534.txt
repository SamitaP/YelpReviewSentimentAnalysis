I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years.  They have the BEST subs ever. BUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town.  They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction.  The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them.  That $2.50 came out of their tip they can hit up their boss for the rest.  Its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards.  Shame on them.
