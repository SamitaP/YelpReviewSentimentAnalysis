So I think this place might be better as a bar than a restaurant and in that case I guess it was just a bit too bad that we went to the place for dinner.Not that the food was bad mind you.  It was just meh.  Hence the meh review.  Anyway the problem was the same across the board - dryness.We started with chicken nachos.  Chicken was a bit dry.  Not enough gooey cheesy saucy mess.  I guess likeable for those who really just want chips.  We asked for extra salsa (and were charged I believe 50 cents extra for each tiny tub woof!) to make it more pleasing.  Most of us got sandwiches which sounded really good on the menu.  And in fact my philly style chicken sandwich was tasty enough... as long as I bit into a part that had cheese on it.  It was grilled chicken peppers carmelized onions and provolone on a bun.  But again it was just a bit on the dry side and there wasn't enough cheese on it to mask that.  One of my tablemates asked if she could get a dipped sandwich - the waitress seemed confused so I guess they don't do that so much down here but for anyone else who is confused that's dipping the whole sandwich into whatever juicy drippings came off of the meat on the sandwich.  Now that would have been an improvement.  Dipping is a bit much for some folks but it would help the drought issue with this place.Bar prices were reasonable I thnk so maybe come here to wet your whistle but think twice before ordering any food that should be served juicy.
