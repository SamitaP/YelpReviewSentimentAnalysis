Stopped in on the Fourth of July for evening cocktail and small meal. From horrible service to terrible seafood...would never return. We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken when there was little crowd around in the restaurant. Then our oyster order came out on a plate of water not ice. They were small and shriveled up and warm. Next the mussels in white wine sauce....hahahah. Um no...it was more like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels were freezing COLD. Had to search for a server to get the check took a long time again. Normally I would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husband's infrequent night out without kids. I did feel strongly enough to write this review. How can a seafood place serve terrible seafood? I have never given a 0 star review and have worked in the food service industry. This place is terrible. Spend your money somewhere else.
