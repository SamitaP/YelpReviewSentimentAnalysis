I wasn't quite as impressed with this place as everyone else seems to be. I ordered a chocolate martini which looked and tasted like a first time bartender made not to mention the glass wasn't close to being full. I had the lobster Mac and Cheese. I only found a few tiny pieces of lobster one with some shell still on it. The Mac and Cheese wasn't anything special either. Our drinks and entrees took so long we asked for our checks as soon as the food came out then had to physically track down a manager to take our pricey checks. Maybe they were understaffed or having an off night but I won't be back.
