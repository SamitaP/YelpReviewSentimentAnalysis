Restaurant dot com you've let me down once again. I've got to ask myself why do I keep doing this. I guess the good restaurants don't have to use coupons. To be fair we ordered the three steak options on the menu all a huge disappointment. First we must of got the sell by this date steaks because its easy to tell what a previously frozen steak tastes like.   Second the New York strip was cut by the first day of culinary school student coincidence Johnson & Wales is so close hmm? No offense to Johnson and Wales but every school/university has drop outs. One side was about 3/4 inch other side an inch and was cooked to a shoe leather consistency. No excuse for an overcooked steak ever and all ordered medium rare.Avoid this place even if free.Oh yeah should of walk out when saw it was also a Hookah lounge seriously?
