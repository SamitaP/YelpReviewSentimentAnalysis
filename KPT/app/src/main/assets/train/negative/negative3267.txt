My sister-in-law husband and I visited this Primanti Bros from all the hype we'd been hearing about it. I have to say its overrated. I wasn't impressed with my sandwich at all. I ordered the chicken breast my hubby got the fish and my SIL got the steak. It had thick white bread an overload of cole slaw and fries. I don't think the meat you order makes a difference in the bland taste as it's overpowered by the slaw and fries. The bread was dry on the crust and yet soggy from the slaw/oil from fries. The wait staff wasn't friendly either. They seemed to have the I don't need try to so hard because we're busy no matter what attitude. We had to go up to the bar to get refills on our drinks after waiting over 10 min. for the waitress to notice we were out. The place was constantly busy due to the full bar and nostalgic feel of the restaurant; it had it's own local charm. I'm glad to say I tried it however I probably wouldn't go back on our next visit.
