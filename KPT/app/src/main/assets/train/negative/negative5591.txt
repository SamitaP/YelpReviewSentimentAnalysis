Crappy boring limpid. The pastrami tasted bland the bread was borderline stale and uninteresting and the whole sandwich was a little wet and lukewarm. Got a Penn Pilsener from the bar and it had the unmistakable taste of dirty lines - a little sour tang of lactic bacteria. How is this place famous? Is it really? Can anyone please just brine some brisket and hand-slice it?
