Clearly based on other reviews I should try this during daylight hours. We went after a long night out landing there around 2:30. I've been to plenty of late night places after-hour bars etc but I've never been as scared as I was at Jo-jo's. 2 fights broke out while we were there. First a group of guys then their girlfriends. Then a guy at the next table threw up on the ground -some splashing on my leg. Then we heard police sirens and the fights were escalating - so we bolted. Maybe this is a rare experience? Anyway - I won't be heading back anytime soon!
