Service was great! Servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable. However the food..... Sucked. The collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt. The corn bread (which is what they are known for) was extremely dry and tasted like it came out of a box. We waited over an hour and a half to be seated (granted we did have a party of 7) only to be disappointed. This was not good Soul Food at all.
