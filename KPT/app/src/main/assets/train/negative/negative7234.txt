The food here was greasy uninspired and bland. The mockmeat chicken was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.I was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.The service was friendly enough though. Not to be recommended unless you're desperate.
