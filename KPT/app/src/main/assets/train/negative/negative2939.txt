The genius of the Olive or Twist name got us in the door here but we didn't have the best experience with their mixers.While here we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini.  The blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum. As a strong drink it was good. However the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink. For the cucumber basil martini the basil is the primary flavor in the drink and kills any undertones of the cucumber. The sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing.In addition to a cocktail menu they also offer a reasonable selection of beers including microbrews.
