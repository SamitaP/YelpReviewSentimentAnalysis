Like a glutton for punishment I hit up Roland's again last night while in town for business. I tired Kaya but the wait was 30 + minutes.Here's the big clue I keep ignoring....the restaurant is EMPTY when everywhere else is crowded. Another issue is there's poor A/C in the dining room which kind of sucks when it's 85 degrees and humid outside. I had a grilled vegetable sandwich and clam chowder. Same as before it was just OK.  Service was better this time though. All in all I preferred my to go taco salad from doba the night before to this meal. Save your money and try somewhere else. PS. Beer selection is impressive if you want to drink beers from all around the world.
