Gotta say I'm not a fan of this place. The prices were very high for the quality of food. Not that the food was bad but it wasn't great and for the price it certainly wasn't good enough. The wait staff was nice and was attentive but would forget things and made our bill ( true it was a party of 10) a freaking nightmare. 2 waitresses recording their own bill so two bills with everyone's items on both bills just randomly. Confusing and a pain. The place it self is nice but when the food isn't very good and way over priced and the bar is SUPER over priced what's the point?
