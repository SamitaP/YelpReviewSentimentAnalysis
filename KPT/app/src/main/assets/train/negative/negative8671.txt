The ONLY reason this place gets two stars and not one is because our server was fantastic: he split our bills no problem didn't screw up water orders put up with a colleague's silly antics and got our food to us promptly. The food was bad yo. Like below Applebee's bad. We split an order of guacamole. For $8.50 you get a tiny dish of it and a bunch of chips in a little bucket. What a crock. The guacamole was fine but for $8.95 you can go to Vida over at Epicenter and get (as I wrote in a previous review) a veritable fuck-ton of it prepared tableside.I also ordered the Southwestern Turkey burger. It sounded delightful - peppers mixed in with the meat jack cheese fried jalepeños - but tasted like garbage. The meat was tasteless but spicy the jalepeños were in five tiny bits on top of the burger the cheese was like plastic. The bun was overly bread-y. I ordered with a side of fruit which was disappointingly not fresh.My colleagues complained that their food sucked too: overly dry burger for $10 and a dried out piece of salmon for $18.50. What the fuck.People don't go here unless you want to get ripped off and eat shitty food.
