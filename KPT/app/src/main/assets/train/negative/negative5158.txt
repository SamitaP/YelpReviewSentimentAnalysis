I took my family of 7 here on sunday 11/9. We arrived at 11AM and by 1:20 we had not received our food. This is after ordering over and hour ago. We noticed the table around us received their food even though they had been seated after us. The waitress was very nice and said she was sorry for the wait several times. I finally asked to see the mgr who I assume is the owner. He finally came to our table and after I explained the situation to him all he did was said that he really cares about his customers and if he made all his customers wait this way he wouldn't have any customers then he walked away. He did nothing to compensate us for the long wait. I go here because it is convenient for everyone. The food is just so so. Well this will be my last visit. I understand everyone can have a slip up but it is how they handle it to make the customer feel better. Ritters gets a Failing Grade in this category and an OK for the food.
