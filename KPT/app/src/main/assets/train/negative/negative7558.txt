sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say that's sick!  (meaning cool awesome sweet wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross. After driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it's Friday- I'll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso's with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls) and noodles.My noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said sign-this ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible. I should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories. But hey on a positive note I did find my dress size at CP Mall!
