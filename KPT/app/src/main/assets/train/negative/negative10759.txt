After visiting a number of restaurants for the buffet I have had some great ones...and some good ones.  Marahani's buffet was a good one.  A quick stop for lunch on the way to the theater provided enough nourishment to keep me from filling up on popcorn!  It was good...the butter chicken the aloo tikki were very good. I was slightly disappointed with the watery tamarind sauce.  I love the sauce when it has a thicker consistency.  The service was sub-typical for buffet.  Not once did the wait staff ask if all was OK...or if we needed anything else.  OK...I am spoiled by better service....but you have to expect it when you are out at a restaurant.  It makes you feel like you are having lunch or dinner where you are really appreciated.
