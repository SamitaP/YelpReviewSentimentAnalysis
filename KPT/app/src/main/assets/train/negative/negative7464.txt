12/11    Most unreliable WiFi in town. The manager will look you straight in the eye and lie to you about a cut antenna but I've tested with multiple devices and times/dates and know this isn't true.1/12     STILL the most unreliable WiFi in town! Does zero good to complain. Obvious they could care less.
