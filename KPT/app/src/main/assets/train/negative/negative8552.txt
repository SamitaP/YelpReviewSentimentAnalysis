It is my opinion there are no good Chinese restaurants Uptown and Soho Bistro continues to prove me right.I have been here two or three times now and I tend to order the more authentic or less popular items such as the beef noodle soup Japanese ramen and they have both let me down.Also whenever I come here for dinner I am literally the only customer in the dining area. I think that Soho Bistro must really be only a lunch place.
