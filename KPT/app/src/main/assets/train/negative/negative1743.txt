Located right next to PNC Park so is a decent place to get a beer and some grub prior to game day. That and outdoor seating are main perks. Otherwise food and prices are not worth a stop. This place will fill up on game day but should be avoided when the Pirates aren't in town. It isn't a BAD experience. If you are siting outside and you have a view of Pittsburgh it can't be that bad.
