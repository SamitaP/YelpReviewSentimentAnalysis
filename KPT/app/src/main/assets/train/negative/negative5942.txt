Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly around 7:10pm. For the first time ever the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc√© in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a Hello from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never received great service here but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out Mark-Pi.P.S. I ordered a Diet Coke and received a glass of what seems to be Robitussin. That or there's alcohol in this drink. Either case I'm not thrilled.
