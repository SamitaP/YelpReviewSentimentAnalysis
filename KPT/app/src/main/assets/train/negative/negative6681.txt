The drinks were fantastic... When we could get a waiters attention.  However the bar closed at 12:00 on a Saturday night.  Furthermore the waiter took almost 20 minutes to sort out our tabs.  I usually love the elbow room however on this particular night it was impossible to get a drink or pay our tab .  I'm not sure we will be back.
