It has been a long time since I have felt the need to Yelp.  Eating here night before last has brought me back to Yelp....and not in a good way.The best thing about our meal was my Diet Coke.The wait staff had to be reminded several times of what we ordered.  The food was not to my liking at all.  Honestly and truly ...as I was eating I was reminded of the scene in National Lampoon's European Vacation when Clark and crew at the French restaurant near the Eiffel Tower.The food tasted like it had been frozen and warmed up.  I have honestly had better RTE meals from Patel Brothers grocery store.  You know the type...the ones that come in the box for like 3 bucks....Very disappointed.
