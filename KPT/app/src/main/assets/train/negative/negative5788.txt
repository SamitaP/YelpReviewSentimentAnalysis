We ordered two pizzas and wings on a Friday night over the phone for pick up. They told us it would be ready in an hour. Sure it's Friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable. My husband showed up an hour later and it was not ready. He had to park illegally because there is absolutely no parking available here and was very worried about the car getting hit. It took another 45 minutes before he actually got the pizza. 1 hour and 45 mins is ridiculously long to wait! They should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed!When we tasted the pizza it was... Okay. The sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland. Kinda like the pizza you'd expect from a street vendor at 3am in the South Side. We will never be back and will remain loyal to Krazy Brothers and Molly's Pizza in dormont for now on.
