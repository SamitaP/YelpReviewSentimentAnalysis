I was very excited to try this place since the closure of Maharaja left us without a good Indian buffet on the side of Pittsburgh where I live and I wasn't crazy about the restaurant that moved in afterward.  The place was relatively deserted on a Saturday afternoon and we were soon greeted by a woman who asked us what kind of naan we wanted (onion or plain).  The food tasted fairly good but what really turned us off was the woman who worked there and her constant coughing hacking and wheezing without even covering her mouth!  Clearly she had a nasty cold and should've stayed home that day!  I cringed every time she went back into the kitchen (we could here her back there hacking up a lung) or came over to our table.  It was so unappetizing that we hardly ate anything and got out of there as soon as possible.  I don't think I can go back there given their low standard of hygiene.  Ick I'm cringing right now thinking of it.  On the plus side though it did keep me from overeating.  Maybe I should have my husband cough and hack at me whenever we go to buffets from now on!Anyway I hate to trash a restaurant but I had to voice my concerns.  I am very conflicted about giving the second star but the food itself wasn't bad.  Try at your own risk!
