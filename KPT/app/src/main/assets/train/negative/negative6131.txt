Coming from the west coast this is probably the worst sushi I have had in a very long time. There are no descriptions for any of the rolls. They do not offer low sodium soy sauce. The wait for 3 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi took over 25 minutes. Now for the food the scallop roll is mushy ( if they were scallops I wouldn't know). Actually everything I ate was mushy. The service was inattentive. I waited 10 minutes for a refill for my iced tea after the owner and another server looked straight at my empty glass.
