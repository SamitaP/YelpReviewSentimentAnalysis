This was absolutely terrible.  It was so highly reviewed but absolutely terrible.  Not that we ate the food because we never had a chance.  We were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server.  There were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took 10+ minutes to bring us drinks.  Still waiting on our drinks our appetizer came out with no silverware no plates still no drinks.  Our server came by (we had already asked him about the drinks once).  Shortly thereafter he brought the drinks still no plates and no silverware.  We waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads.  Still no plates and no silverware.  When we asked again about the plates he laughed as though we had made some strange request.  We continued to wait - no chopsticks no silverware no plates - after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  It's the only place that we've ever done that before - and we have had some terrible service.  The food that we stared at looked terrible - in hindsight I'm glad that we had no utensils.  If you have an hour to kill are looking for terrible service aren't in a rush and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it out; otherwise stay away!
