The minute you step into this OG you will get the stench of smelly socks. Very hard to un-notice the smell. Service was poor the waitress was just trying to get rid of us ASAP even though we went in at 8PM (not too late for dinner in my opinion). The place is not clean the table we sat was sticky.Food was in par with the other OGs. Will I go there again ? nah for the amount of money I pay I would go some place else - that at the least doesnt smell.Im giving this two stars only for the food.
