Hubby loves this place...I however do not really care too much for it. The curries are too sweet and their stirfry's are always packed with too much cabbage! and I mean raw cabbage. I also don't understand how they expect us to eat dry stirfry with rice.  We eat here if hubby has serious thai food hankering and I have decided to stick with their noodles which are actually decent.
