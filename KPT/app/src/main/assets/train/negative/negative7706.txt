My wife and her family took me here for my birthday the service was ok we had about 12 people nothing too big. We had two servers both were pretty nice. We ordered food kept it going like a normal service I got the Bar Harbor and it was pretty awesome I got them to add Cajun seasoning into it since I like spicy food. But rather good couldn't complain.BUT my wife's grandma got a steak and Lobster she order a medium and it came out well done and her lobster was raw no idea how this happened considering you cook them at two different times but so be it. She sent it back and by the time she got it back we had already ate all our food and had finished desert. I mean what the heck how does it take that long to cook a medium steak? It doesn't! By the time she got her food she wasn't hungry anymore.So we get the checks and the server tells me that the manager comped her food since it was messed up and that we wouldn't have to worry about paying for it. Well then they gave her another bill and said that she had to pay for it how the hell that works is beyond me but she was stuck paying for the damn food that the manager told us we would get credited. Near the end of the service the servers lacked and kind of vanished and it was just a huge cluster. The quality of this place just tanked and fell low.The only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb!!! Everything else is a joke.
