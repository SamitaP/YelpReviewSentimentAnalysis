I have been to this place plenty of times. I have always had good meals and service. But tonight was bad. I went ther with my wife's work friends. We sat at the bar tables and had a bartender named Bo(very red hair)   We had About 8 people and he insisted that if we sit at the tables we have to order food which we had planned to do. He seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinks(it was Friday and happy hour so we were sitting around chatting and drinking)  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but Bo seemed very disinterested in us until it came time to pay the bill then he was really nice(tip time! Overall the food is good there but Bo did not make it a pleasant experience. Smile Bo it will get you far in life!
