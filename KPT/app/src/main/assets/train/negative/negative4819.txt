I had high hopes for Taste of India after reading the reviews but I was not impressed. The food did not taste fresh (I had pakoras and an eggplant dish) and the rice was definitely old and crisp from sitting in the bottom of the cooker. I asked for spicy and my dish was quite mild. We were there toward the end of the night and the staff seemed resentful of our presence. As much as I love Indian food I'll probably give Taste of India one more chance sometime earlier in the evening. I hope to report back with at least one additional star.
