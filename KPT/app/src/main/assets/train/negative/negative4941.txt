If you have been to any other PHO restaurant in any other city Tram's Kitchen would be OUT OF BUSINESS! For starters the portion of the PHO is extremely SKIMPY! I don't think we have had such a small portion of PHO since we were Babies! Seriously would it kill you to add more rice noodles? Since we had the PHO as our Appetizers we then ordered the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles...Oh wait...we paid for Seafood...but all we got were vegetables and some imitation they call seafood. What a Joke! Suggestion if you plan on going here. Come FULL and just order the Spring Roll.
