I went here with a social group for drinks/meal on a Thursday evening. We had the upstairs reserved just for us. The atmosphere was comfortable. The downstairs [outside of our group] was dead. The physical layout of this place is impressive. On the outside it looks like a corner business. But its really a full restaurant with an upstairs area. Anyways back to the actual experience. They served food upstairs for our group which was cool but you had to put your credit card down as a tab. [Not an issue]. The bar selection is ok. The food was ok. The issue I have with this place is that when you go to pay out they give you a post swiped transaction. This is the receipt that shows the total card transaction details tip and total. They did not give a receipt detailing the full itemized service. After requesting the receipt and giving a quick look at it I paid and put down a tip. After looking at the receipt later it turns out that there was a gratuity charge already added to the receipt. I find this to be very deceptive and FRAUDULENT. Adding grautity to a bill doesn't bother me. It bothers me when 1. it was never stated that would be there 2. when you don't have sitdown service with a waiter [the social group I was with was more of freeflowing in the bar area] To add insult to injury they try to play the club vibe outside. They put up velvet ropes and use a door man. There was no line and secondly giving an impression of an exclusive club is a joke when there is only a handful of people at the bar downstairs. Vibe: DeadFood: DecentDrinks: Typical selectionDrink price: $5 for a beer. [Mid range for downtown]Would I go here again? No. Absolutely not.I've been to the ballantyne location twice and I can't say that's a bad place.
