I came here with a friend for her birthday and the food really isn't particularly special.  Portions are decent and I guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food. The outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring but the inside patio area was pretty nice actually.Overall I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  If I was offered to eat this food for free sure I'd take a helping but probably not seconds.
