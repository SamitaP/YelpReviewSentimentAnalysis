My family and I stopped here tonight. We live very close and have yet to ever go. What a mistake. When you first walk in you are assaulted with pastel palette and an over abundance of mauve. This is more 80's than my grandmothers house. I could ignore the decor if the service was better. It was horrible. Our waitress came twice then disappeared.  Apparently she went home sick and no one else came to pick up our table for over 20 min. Smooth. So when we finally got our food I was really hoping for greatness. I don't know why I was expecting good food when everything else wasn't.  I ordered veal with peppers.  17.99. I got less than a third of a pepper on my plate with 3 tiny extremely thin tough pieces of veal. It was supposed to be served with a brandy sherry sauce. Nope. It was a white wine butter sauce. The description also didn't mention the veal was scallopine. It was. Probably could of given myself a paper cut with these. The experience was awful the service was horrendous the decor cannot be unseen and everything was a good 5 to 7 dollars over priced. Will never go back to this place again.
