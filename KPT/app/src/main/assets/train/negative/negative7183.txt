Well to start crepes aren't a Parisian concept.  They are solely a Brittany thing!  Therefore the fact that this chain of restaurants carries a name like Crepes Parisiennes is pretentious.  That aside the crepes are okay nothing special.  I've had much lighter (crepes here were a bit heavier than they should be) and more authentic crepes elsewhere.  The other thing I do not like about this place are their hours. They are closed by 4pm and on Mondays and stop serving savory crepes at 3pm???
