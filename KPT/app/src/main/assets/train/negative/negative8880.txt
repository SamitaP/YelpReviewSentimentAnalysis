I had high expectations considering that I was in the South.  I love the food in the South!  However the experience here was not very good!  I grew up eating most of the food on the menu and I tend to make strong comparisons against that home cooking.  In addition I love food and I have a wide taste bud ranging from various regions of the world.The food was delivered to me at my table very very very very very hot.  I was unable to comfortably eat for approx. 7 to 10 minutes.   I ordered Fried Chicken Greens Yams Catfish and Banana Pudding.  The previous day my business colleague order and ate the red beans and rice.Service was good.  The menu needs help.1) The Fried Chicken wasn't really fried.  It looked like baked chicken that was dried out.  Not crispy looking not seasoned. Not very tasty.2) The Catfish was a complete fish with bones.  The taste was pretty good! However I would have enjoyed it more had I not had to de-bone every bite.3) The Greens were good!4) Yams were good!5) Corn bread was just ok6) Banana Pudding was very good!7) Red beans rice and sausage was not good.All and all the Merts was just ok  However if in town again I would not be compelled to re-visit...and I love Soul Food.
