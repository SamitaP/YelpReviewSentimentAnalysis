Overcharged $19 and having a food order messed up twice what more could you ask for? A waitress that doesn't seem to care about any of this? Wish granted!So yeah my food was pretty bland though my girlfriend said her food was OK overall. Overpriced for what it really was.I may have come back if it wasn't for the first two items. Instead I'll leave them as a shining failure to customer service.
