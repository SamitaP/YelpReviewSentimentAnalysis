I'm sorry this place is simply not good. Unfortunately it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese too much butter and cream and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. Someone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It's already a travesty that it's served to me before the meal but to put it on my sandwich! I'm actually offended for Italians and bread. Yes bread this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.I'll admit it I'm already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself family and friends and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I've had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another Italian joint I'm heading in with high expectations.Is this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield I'm sad to say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming and I hear the owners are great but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere.
