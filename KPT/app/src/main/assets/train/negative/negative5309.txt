I should preface this by saying this wasn't my pick and not really my kind of place.  That being said it's a decent conventional style restaurant and not bad for what it is. I had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy.  The boiled red skinned potatoes were pretty much what you'd expect boiled red skinned potatoes to be and they come with melted butter on the side in case you'd really like to pack an artery.  This is definitely not a meal for anyone worried about TMAO.I don't want to be too hard on the place because you know it is what it is and for what it is it's not that bad not that good just ok; something like that.  Now I just wonder how long that burger is going to remain in my gut.  I think I can feel the bacteria burping away in there right about now... Ugh.
