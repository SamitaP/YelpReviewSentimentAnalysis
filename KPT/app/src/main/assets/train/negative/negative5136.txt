Joyce was a great server. She took great care of our party of 7 and was very personable. Cheap average diner food. You can have subpar breakfast lunch or dinner at any time of the day! Best consumed late night when nothing else is open. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here besides a late-night drunk snack.
