I had carryout. Very quick but kinda confusing to find the place. I was expecting good things because the reviews seem to rave about this place but honestly I was really disappointed. The food is mediocre I have had WAY better and I can't say that anything I had was really that great. I'll be looking for a different chinese place to eat at.
