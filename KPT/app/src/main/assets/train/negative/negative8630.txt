The only really great thing I can say about Rock Bottom is their location it was perfect right before going out on a Friday night but that's it.  Their menu is WAY overpriced with nothing really great on it.  I just got the nachos (found as an appetizer) and my friend got the burger.  The nachos were overcooked and semi-stale.  The beer was decent it's just draft beer here.  Service was good and the atmosphere was fine.  But I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.
