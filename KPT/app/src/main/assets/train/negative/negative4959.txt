Visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and wanted some Vietnamese so we stopped by here expecting to find the best pho in Pittsburgh. The restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant. The menu is small with very limited choices. Service is minimal. We ordered some spring roll appetizer which was pretty good. Then we had 3 different kind of pho for our main entree. We ordered a sate soup a Saigon soup and a pho Hanoi soup. Only decent one was the pho Hanoi soup which isn't really like the typical pho. No beef tripe tendon or beef balls in the soup and the noodles are fatter then what you'd find in typical pho. There was also excessive MSG in the soup dishes.
