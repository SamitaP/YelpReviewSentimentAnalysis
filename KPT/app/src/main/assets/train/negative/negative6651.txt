I have dined at the elbow room twice now. First time I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and believe it or not it was the worst grilled cheese I have had. I know what you are thinking......how can you mess up grilled cheese? I am still asking myself that question. I gave it another try last night because I did like the decor and the service was good. I thought maybe the cook was having a bad night. I had the Norman Rockwell burger and although it wasn't prepared as rare as I prefer it was tasty. I was beginning to change my mind about this place until I decided to use the restroom.  Walking into this place you would never imagine that the bathroom would be filthy. The decor is nice the service is great the food is average and the bathroom is undescribable.
