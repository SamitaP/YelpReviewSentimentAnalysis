FILET MIGNON NOT AS ADVERTISEDWe ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi.  The flavor was ok we asked for the filet to be medium and it arrived well done was very chewy and we suspect a chuck roast or some other inferior cut of beef was substituted for the filet.  False advertising at its best--shouldn't that be illegal?The fried rice that came with it was ok but we were not offered a choice of steamed rice or noodles.  Other hibachi places we have been to plate noodles and steamed or fried rice together.The miso soup was very salty and murky and not very flavorful.  The salad had a lot of water at the bottom of the bowl and was made up of head lettuce only (anyone ever heard of a salad spinner)--not very appetizing.We also ordered sushi (all cooked ingredients) it was just ok and not the best I have experienced.The waitress was slow and had to be asked for refills on our hot tea.  The whole meal took almost an hour and a half and cost $75.00 tip included.  Not worth the price time gas and wear and tear on the car to get there.
