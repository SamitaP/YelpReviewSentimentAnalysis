Walking by on a Saturday morning I was pleased to see that they offered a weekend brunch and an alternative to the overcrowded and overrated Pamela's next door.  I ordered an omelette for $9 and a fruit plate for $7 and my wife ordered a grilled chicken salad.  My wife's salad was good.  My omelette however was inedible -- a round rock-hard disk smothered in cheese.  In a addition we ordered a fruit plate for $7 which was a complete embarassment of several tiny pieces of fruit strewn about a plate with a tiny souffle cup of yogurt.  I hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad. I told the server as nicely as possible that it wasn't her fault and I didn't want to appear difficult but I just could not eat the omelette and the fruit plate was really unappealing and overpriced.  She gave me an icy cold look that communicated You are a crazy difficult demanding jerk but took the food back and took it off my check.  Upon reading some of the reviews here it seems like I am not alone.
