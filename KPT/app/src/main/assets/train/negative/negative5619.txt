I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:a) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this townb) yinzers wouldn't know good thai food if it flew into their open mouthsThis place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner's masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly the joint was slammed. On the bright side service was very fast. On the downside our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.The takeaway: If you're from Pittsburgh you'll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there. But if you've enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis steer clear.p.s. food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality.
