Went here for a pre-show meal. We were looking forward to the beers and fortunately or unfortunately (depending upon your viewpoint) that was the highlight of the meal. I ordered the ribs which were dry and not that hot. Also they were not that tender. Their sweet sauce however was good but no sauce can make up for poorly cooked ribs. My wife had the chicken pesto pasta. While that was decent it wasn't exciting either.Sure the plates were sizeable. But PRICEY for what you get. I mean we could have gone to Aria Italian nearby and gotten a MUCH better quality of food for LESS than this place! I mean we went here thinking we would get a good value. Unfortunately it's more than a lot of other comparable places in Uptown.Too many other choices in Charlotte to come back here.
