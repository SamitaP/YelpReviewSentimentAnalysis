Service was great however the food was mediocre.  Hostess needs to be more educated about the menu she was unable to give details on menu items.Lets start the with fries that seem to be mandatory with each entree.  They had to be cooked prior to us ordering or even getting there.  They were cold limp (pause) and over salted.  The burger was just eh.  Grilled onions seemed to be just warmed on the grill and the beef patty could have used a bit more flavor.  Fat has the flavor people!Oh the floor at our first table was filthy.  Then the table at the second table was filthy.  What's up with that?Overall this joint was not that great.
