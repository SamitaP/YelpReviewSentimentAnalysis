I use to pass by this place all the time. It always seemed dark and dingy from the outside. I still haven't been for the nightlife but we ended up here for breakfast because there was literally nothing else open on the morning of July 4th. I was open to the idea of eating here but the breakfast was pretty disappointing. My friend's chocolate chip pancakes were small in diameter undercooked and only had a few chips per pancake. My breakfast burrito didn't have the cheese I asked for and was pretty average. I needed a lot of ketchup because they really didn't try to put much salsa in it. My friends bacon was tiny (I mean 1 inch long 1/4 inch wide) and far too salty. Anyway I wish I wasn't so hungry or I wouldn't have gone here in the first place. Would've loved to spend the 10 bucks or so on somewhere else :-/
