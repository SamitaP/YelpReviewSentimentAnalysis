Was there at a busy time -- Mother's Day dinner -- and the service was poor with a waitress who did not ask specifics and was slow to deliver things like hot mustard and kept us waiting for our order for over an hour.  Not all her fault.  And the food was ordinary.  Not bad a little tasteless but why bother?
