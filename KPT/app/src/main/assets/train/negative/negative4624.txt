Not great. Stale bread and the food was strongly over-flavored. I had a glass of wine and was asked if I wanted another and I said just a half glass which I ask for all the time (and get). The reply from the waitress was we can't do that and the same from the manager. CAN'T do that? Terrible attitude - more like WON'T do that. Well I WON'T be going back
