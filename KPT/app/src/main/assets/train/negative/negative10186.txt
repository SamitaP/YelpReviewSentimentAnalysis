The in-laws were in town this past weekend so we decided to show them the newly opened Romare Bearden Park. The park was a lot of fun and after checking it out we decided to stroll over to French Quarter for lunch. I had high hopes for French Quarter given my love of Uptown restaurants and my affinity for Cajun-inspired food but I have to say both the food and the customer service was a major letdown.Our server was not very attentive forgot what we ordered brought our food out without silverware and took several minutes to provide us with silverware so that we could actually eat and failed to refill our drinks. The restaurant was also FREEZING... last Saturday was literally the nicest day of the year and they had the air on what had to be 65 totally unnecessary! Once we were finally able to eat our food it was a) cold from us not getting silverware for a few minutes and the restaurant being crazy cold & b) not that great. The gumbo tasted like it came from a can and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant.If the food and service wasn't enough to leave a bad impression the restrooms were disgusting and there was no toilet paper. I will definitely not be returning to French Quarter... which is a shame because they're in a primo location!
