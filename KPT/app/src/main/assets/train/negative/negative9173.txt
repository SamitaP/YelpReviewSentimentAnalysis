If this is great Southern Food then I am a craw dad .  The Okra was not fresh and rather tasteless  the fish special wasn't fresh and was small and the cabbage was mushy.  I was married to a Mobile girl and this is not what I expected for Soul Food.. But it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent.
