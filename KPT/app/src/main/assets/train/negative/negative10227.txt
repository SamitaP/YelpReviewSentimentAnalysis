From my one and only visit today so far I rate this restaurant poorly because it took the server a long time to come to my table after I was seated. I ordered something on the menu called Sly Scottie because next to it in italics it said 'We're famous for this one!' It sounded okay: Turkey broccoli and cranberry sauce on top of a muffin (they mean English muffin). But when it came out it just looked like a bowl of lard. It also felt like I was eating a bowl of lard. I should have probably ordered from the diet menu. Haven't had this bad of an experience in a while.
