Finding a good ol' diner in Pittsburgh isn't exactly easy. Pamela's has great breakfast but is in no sense a diner and there are many good sandwich shops but once again they aren't diners.Having only been there once so far my review may be a little skewed. The restaurant has the diner feel no doubt. There are jukebox machines at every table up front and the decorations harken to the setting of a greasy spoon restaurant.It was busy when we went so the food took a while. The wait seemed longer than it should have been but as I said the place was packed and it was exactly lunchtime. On the menu it stated that they used premium maple syrup but I'm pretty sure I just got corn syrup in a cup. The coffee was somewhat watery but still alright.I ordered the french toast with eggs and bacon all of which was rather bland (Except the bacon a meat which has some inherent godliness to it. You can't mess it up). Basically it seemed like a meal I could have whipped up lazily on my own and in less time. The bread for the french toast was plain white toast and I normally prefer a better bread. The eggs were eggs: good without any pizzazz.While Ritters is cheap from my small sampling I found the food boring. Most good diners have some excellent menu item and perhaps I drew the short straw. I might return to Ritters later but it's certainly not the diner I'm looking for.
