So far really slow food service . Took over half an hour to get main entree after getting the drinks and appetizer.  Server was good but my filet medallion was off . A second filet medallion was undercooked. By this time I was done with my ribswhich were very tasty and my sides and I asked to see the manager. The manager gave an apology and only charged for the ribs. okay but won't be going back soon . My Strawberry Limeadean alcoholic beverage was great!
