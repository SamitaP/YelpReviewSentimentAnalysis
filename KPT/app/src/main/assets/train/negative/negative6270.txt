I give this place an OKAY because I've had mixed experiences. The first time I went it was okay but was very forgettable.The last time I went we were seated outside on the balcony and the outdoor heating was nice our waiter was polite and well spoken. The only thing was that our food took... forever... to come. When we asked about the status of our order the food came right away.In terms of food they have a pretty good selection but... once again forgettable. It's a nice and casual place to go but don't expect more.
