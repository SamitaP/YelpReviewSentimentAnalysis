This place has some wonderful sandwiches. I work in the building next door so I frequent most of the dowtown (or as they call it uptown) establishments during the week.  They offer Boar's Head and normally offer a daily or weekly special.  This place gets a 2 b/c they have the worst customer service the unfriendliest staff and got a 94.5 on cleaniness rating. Although the sandwiches are good its not worth having some lady bark at you for your order before you can even see the menu.  They need to hire some people that can smile.
