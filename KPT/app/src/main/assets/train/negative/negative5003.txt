Don't believe the hype.Was in the Pittsburgh area for one day and decided to try the pho here.  It was a toss up between Pho Minh and here.  I think I chose wrong.A rule of thumb is a good ethnic restaurant will be swarming with that particular ethnic people.  When I went all I saw were non-Asians.  Ordered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable. It did not taste flavorful and authentic but maybe that's what is available in Pittsburgh.Another sour note they dropped off some spring rolls at our table.  It was our first time there and I thought they were complimentary so we ate them.Later on we saw them on our bill.  WE DIDN'T EVEN ORDER THEM.They were overpriced and not worth it.Be careful if they drop off food or drinks at your table they will bill you for it afterwards even if you didn't order it.
