I got the fried rice with beef and it was so-so.  I've had better.  The restaurant was decent andthe staff was friendly and fast.  But the food was just ok and I have to admit that while I was eating it I was a little worried if I would get sick or not.  But to be fair the other people I was eating with loved their food.  I heard the tempura vegetables were great.  Unfortunatley my experience was just mediocre. Thats the way it goes though but  I will give them another shot  roll with the punches and try a different dish.  I'll keep you posted.
