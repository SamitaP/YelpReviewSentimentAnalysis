I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade but like Del's it's becoming one of those places where the food gets worse every time you go there.  Today half the lettuce I had on my Caesar salad was rotten.  I have no idea why it ever left the kitchen.  And it was take-out too so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.  (They gave me the wrong entr√©e too but at least it was edible.)I finally think I'm done with this place.
