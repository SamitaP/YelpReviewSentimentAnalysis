Started out with wedding soup that was so salty it was almost inedible. Asked for the house wine and was given a glass of wine that cost $9.00. (My fault I should have asked I guess.) Meals were OK but nothing special. Even the bread was just so-so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals and we both experienced serious gastro-intestinal problems after our dinners.
