I always used to make sure to have dinner here during my yearly visits to Pittsburgh.This will be the last time as the food was mediocre and the restaurant  looked like it was neglected. There are many new and better restaurants to choose from.The sad state this once cutting edge restaurant devolved into is a real shame as it used to be one of Pittsburgh's best.
