Went in for the Thanksgiving Day meal that they offer.  They indicate the two options are for 3 or 6 people.  We had 4 so chose the the meal that feeds 6 to take back leftovers.  Unfortunately they provided for for 4 people even only brought out 4 pieces of pie for desert.  After getting about one spoon of dressing we asked for extra and were charged for it!  We ordered a bottle of wine when ordering the food that did not arrive until we were half way done eating.  Service wasn't that great either had to ask for things twice before getting the.Needless to say after ordering and paying for a dinner that is supposed to feed 6 we brought nothing home.  It was my parents uncle and myself not exactly a group that should go through a Thanksgiving meal that is supposed to feed 6.This place may be worth the money for the regular menu (never been there for that though) but felt cheated on this TG meal.
