The food was pretty good but the service was the worst I have experienced in a long time! Went here with a client for dinner on a week-night and had the most surly and unhelpful server ever.  We had a reservation but were mostly ignored and both the hostess and server acted as if we were unwanted vagrants walking in off the streets. We wanted to order a bottle of wine and asked for some suggestions... this was a waste of time because the server either knew nothing about wine or just didn't feel like being bothered.  Fortunately we were able to find a decent wine on the menu without any help from the server. It's truly a shame that I cannot support a local entrepreneur over a corporate chain but honestly I get much better service down at places like Capital Grill and McCormick & Schmicks... next time I have a client to impress that's where I'll head instead of LaVecchias. :-(
