Do not waste your money! The gumbo tasted like the roux had burned and there was no salt whatsoever. I ordered the blackened chicken to be safe thinking no one can mess up blackened chicken.....I was wrong. None of the food (including the blackened chicken) were seasoned with salt and pepper. This was the most bland overpriced food I'd ever had in the city. I ordered my toddler the chicken strip little gators meal. The fries were the best thing out of the entire meal. The service was as also dry and not very friendly or inviting from the hostess to the waiter Brandon. Geez I know it's a Tuesday night (we arrived at 5:30) but at least show some enthusiasm as I arrive to spend a whopping $123 (4 entrees 4 alcoholic bevs 1 kids meal) on a below average meal. It would've been more had we been charged for the uneaten cup of gumbo.
