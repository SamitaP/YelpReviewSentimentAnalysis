If you're in the mood for fresh tasty sushi this is not the place for you. The food that was delivered to us was simply inedible. Point blank. My husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day so we splurged a little spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.It was so awful we just stared at each other amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice right? It tasted like rotten fish as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. We had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible horrible horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.We tried to call and complain but by the time our order was delivered the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money.
