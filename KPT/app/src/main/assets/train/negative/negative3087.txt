We ate at Primanti Bros based on the reviews on Yelp hoping to get a real taste of Pittsburgh. What I ordered was a sandwich labeled Pittsburgher Cheese Steak. What I got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat cole slaw and mediocre fries on white bread. The sandwich was very small but I only ate 1/2 of it anyway and I have a pretty big appetite. I recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.I was truly shocked. That was the worst meat that I have seen since Junior High School. We would have been much better off at Burger King. Luckily we had a nice lunch at Salim's to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths.
