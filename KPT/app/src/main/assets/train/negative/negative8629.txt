Nothing here really blew me away..  Yeah it's pretty cool that they brew their own beers and they are located on Tryon but... eh.  This spot is one step above an Applebees.  Dont get me wrong I kinda like Applebees.  Just dont expect anything amazing.  I would suggest sitting outside and enjoying a nice day.  That might make it a little better.  I would also suggest you try the artichoke/crab dip.  That was rather delicious.  I would say give it a try but know.. There are much better places in the city.  Enjoy!-Ian M.
