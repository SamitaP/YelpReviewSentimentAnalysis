Doc's is a good bar to go to when you are with friends and don't have any set plans for the evening.  However if you need to be somewhere fast I wouldn't advise going here.  The past times I've eaten at Doc's it's been on the large outdoor patio upstairs.  The patio is nice and provides for a lot of seating however it hasn't been updated in several years.  I recently made a trip to BRGR the new gourmet burger joint several blocks away and their outdoor seating is quite hard to beat.  The food at Doc's is what you would expect to find at a greasy/beer/bar.  Cheese fries burgers some salads mediocre pasta etc.  Although some of their dishes in the past have been much better than I anticipated the food isn't something I leave the place remembering.  There is smoking allowed on the patio upstairs so if you don't mind smoke then no worries.  However if you don't like to breathe in smoke while you're eating pray that there is no one smoking in your section when you go.  There are space heaters upstairs in the winter for when it starts to get cold before the snow comes.  It is nice to be outside and still be warm but the food and beer pretty much stay the same year round.I wouldn't say no if someone asked me to join them for a drink at Doc's but I would probably suggest eating somewhere else first.  You'll get your food faster and be able to breathe a bit better in a different restaurant.
