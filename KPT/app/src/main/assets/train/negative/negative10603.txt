This place makes me cringe! I've dined here with large groups of friends when we needed to have a big table and they all wanted to be bursting full of cheap food and that is really the only excuse to go to this place. One reviewer mentioned the 90's music and the goofy food art on the walls. I could not agree more that this is so funny. Whoa and talk about noisy. This place is deafening inside on a Friday or Saturday night worse than a cafeteria. I think that everyone with a City-Pass crams in there in search of the best two-for-one deal on a massive mound of macaroni slathered in dreadful red sauce and salty cheese. I actually ordered a salad as my main the last time that I dined there because I know how universally disappointing the pasta dishes were and they actually screwed up a salad. I am not sure what on earth it was supposed to be but they called it a chopped salad and it had a little M next to it in the menu as if it were a specialty of the house. I asked for grilled chicken on top and received a dried out piece of leather sitting above a mess of lettuce beans nuts cheese and peppers. Just plain salty and awful. Everything was either from a can or a jar. I do agree with others who have said that the service is very fast and friendly. They kept the beer and wine flowing at our table at every visit. I think that is why so many of my friends just shovel this stuff down. Ah well  Arrivederci (no more) Mama Ricotta
