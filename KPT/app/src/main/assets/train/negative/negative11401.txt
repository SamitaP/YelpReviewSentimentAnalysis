Having a taste for some soul food and reading the previous reviews the family went there for dinner last night. I had high hopes for the quality but I was disappointed. The sign said for when you miss ya mama's cooking but I have to confess my mother did not prepare macaroni and cheese with velveeta nor did she make candied yams from canned sweet potatoes. . And that struck me right away. The cornbread was good although a bit dried giving me the impression that they were from a day earlier or so. The tilapia was well seasoned and so were the chicken wings although both were a bit heavy-headed on the salt. I felt like this place was the place to go back in the day but the home cooked soul food has clearly corners cut and that impacted that slow cooked taste that soul food usually renders.
