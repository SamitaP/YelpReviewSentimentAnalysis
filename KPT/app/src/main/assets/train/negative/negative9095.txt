I had such high hopes for this place but it fell short in many ways. I had their fried green tomatoes and for $6 I got 4 slices of skinny green tomatoes deep fried and over battered.  Tried their fried chicken it wsa crispy but why is the portion so small. The table cloth is grimy and sticky..Try a Waffle house and I think you'll have a better dining experience.
