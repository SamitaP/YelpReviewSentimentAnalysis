Here's how you can make your own Primanti Bros Sandwich at home:Take two slices of Italian Bread between them mash together bland cole slaw fries some assorted meat tomatoes. And at your fingertips is Pitt's pride and joy.  I'm not from here so maybe I don't share the love. We weren't really drunk when we were eating here and it was in the middle of the day. The service was pretty slow but when our order was taken the sandwich came out very fast.It was a good sandwich in terms of having really hot meat and cold tomatoes and cole slaw but I didn't think its as tasty as it could have been.I think the bread should be buttered and toasted/grilled texas toast and they should use seasoned fries. Use some sweet North Carolina style Cole slaw. I came I saw and I conquered but I'm giving it back. I probably won't be back ever again.
