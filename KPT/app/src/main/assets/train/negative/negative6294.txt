Dear Pittsburgh we are foodies from Boston.  The wonderful thing about living in a city like Boston is that there are few chain restaurants but infinite amounts of local-owned restaurants with hip atmosphere and delicious food made with fresh ingredients and a whole lotta passion.  I understand you're hard up but this place made your list of top 25 restaurants in the city?  Seriously?  The decor looked much like many homes in the suburbs outside your city-a little bit o' this and a little bit o' that but that is beside the point.  Swarmy waiters you have to flag down for service (and by the way the locals were having to do it too) is not charming or cool.  It's unacceptable.  Especially when a restaurant has the audacity to charge what this place was for a crappy meal.  And I'm telling you other than the Thai corn chowder this food was barely edible.  What with all the Kings and Eat-n-Parks you may not know this but trust me a visitor from the land of delicious this is just gross.  And to pay anywhere over $100 for gross (or even anywhere edging up to $100) is just a slap in the face.  It's time for Pittsburgh to get standards that are above ground.  A restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top 25.
