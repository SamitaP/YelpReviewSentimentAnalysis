Have you guys been here in the daylight? This place is filthy! I understand this place is old but wash the curtains (they look like they've been in a flood) and those glass lamps hanging from the ceiling. The woodwork and floor are sticky. We had a Guinness (in the wrong glass I must add) and didn't have the stomach to eat anything. All this place needs is a good wash. Let me know when we'll go back.
