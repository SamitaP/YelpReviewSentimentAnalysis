I have never had such awful inedible food at such an appallingly ridiculous price. It's not only a failure in execution the plates are very poorly put together and the flavors of the sides and sauces with the protein do not marry well at all. I was severely disappointed by plating and then just got mad when I started eating.You would think for 44$ your steak would at least be properly cooked. What was supposed to be medium came raw. The steak was tough and tasteless. Ahi tuna asked rare was overcooked; also bland even with the sauce. The oshinko side was laughable. Seriously. I laughed.  pasta was overcooked and by the time it got to us the sauce was laminated with coagulating fat. The sushi was an amatuer attempt at best.  There was too much rice and presentation was sad. Ambience is tacky. Ugly 80s-reminiscent wallpaper covers half the room and framed sketches of fish plaster the other half.Service was the only redeeming quality. To put it in perspective my neighborhood Houlihans seems gourmet next to this place.
