We heard that this place had amazing pancakes and was always extremely busy. We took our chances and arrived around 9:45am. It was open seating and we were easily able to find a table.First off - you can only pay cash. That is a huge turn off especially if you are out of town. Personally I never carry cash and frankly I don't know many people who do. This place isn't worth going to an ATM for.Several people at my table ordered the pancakes so I got french toast. It was incredible eggy. If you like that then you will like these but I don't prefer to have a layer of egg on my french toast. I tried a friends hot cakes and they were okay. They are super thin and crispy on the outside. I prefer a thick fluffy pancake. :(I also didn't love the service we received. The server came over with several plates and was extremely rude about us not speaking up enough about whose food was what even though we were telling her it was ours. I wanted a refill on my orange juice but the next time our waitress came around she gave us the bill - thanks!
