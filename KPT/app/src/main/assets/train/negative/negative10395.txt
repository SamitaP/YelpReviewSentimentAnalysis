I wish I'd read the recent reviews before venturing here on a Saturday evening. I should've known something was up when we were one of only four parties in the restaurant on a Saturday evening at 7:00 p.m.After being seated it took our waiter forever to come to our table. The fella and I both had a really hard time understanding him because of his heavy accent so that clouded some of our evening. He was nice enough when he was at the table but it took him FOREVER to ask us for our drink order bring us our drinks ask us for our food order etc. He also addressed us as lady and gentleman which was odd.The food was fine. I got the pork and the fella got the halibut. Fine. The end.We went to the bar after dinner to have a drink and the bartender disappeared into the back just as we sat down. We waited 5-10 minutes for her to come back and when she didn't we walked over to BLT Steak where we got much better bar service.When I think about the other fine dining restaurants in Charlotte Blue really doesn't hold a candle to their service or atmosphere. What a bummer to spend that much money and be that underwhelmed.
