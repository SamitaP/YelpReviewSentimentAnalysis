Well what is to be said about this place for starter in just moving into Charlotte many of my coworkers and friends have recommend this place saying its some of the best Chinese food in town. As a food Connoisseur I enjoy Chinese food a lot but upon having high hope for finding a new place to enjoy some delicious cuisine the lack luster effort has seized to impress my expectations. The quality of the food has ranged from okay to mediocre while the portions range can differ upon a full meal for an adult to emergency rations that in turn causes the meal to become inconsistent and make not worth it's full price. It also seems that the cook doesn't put care into his work often times making the experience to be a let down and it seems to be the same at the all of the locations. My final verdict is poor this place has a lot of work for improvement.
