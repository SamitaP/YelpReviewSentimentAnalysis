They have a tough time here with the lunch rush.  You HAVE to go at off hours get there 11:45 or 12:45 but not in between because you will wait.  And when you finally get your table if you all get sushi it will come out at the same time.  If you all get stir fry dishes they will come out at the same time.  But if half the table gets stir fry and the other gets sushi then GOOD LUCK.  Our stir fry eaters were completely done eating by the time our sushi came out.  There was only one sushi chef on duty. For the lunch rush you need to be prepared!!!  They do have daily sushi specials (the Tsunami roll recently....uh a little 'tongue in cheek' guys?) and the Volcano Roll.  They will run you about 8 or 9 bucks per roll.  The rolls were put together so fast that they were sploppy and loose so it was hard to pick them up and dip them but overall not bad tasting....  The stir fry dishes are your MSG delight portion sizes are ok and they come with an egg roll.
