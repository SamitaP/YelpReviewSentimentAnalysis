Used to be so good...but the food and service has deteriorated in the last few years.Carpaccio....one of my favorite items on their menu is now served without toast points. You must request them...then they only bring a few. Last time it was served on a very hot plate...by the time we got the toast some if the carpaccio was cooked. Horrible.I have enjoyed the venison dish in the past...it was always tender and succlent. Last visit it was so rare and chewey I could not enjoy it. I asked the waitress about it and she replied They've always cooked it rare. The crab cakes: I know that most German menus probably don't include crab cakes! But most nice restaurants do so it is pretty standard fare. Their crab cakes are very crabby but also include either tuemeric or curry which is entirely unexpected and does not add to the dish.Their famous salad: The Waldhorn salad baby greens towering over delicious cucumber salad orzo salad carrot salad and delicious german potato salad. This dish is just amazing! For us it is the only reason to return to Waldhorn's!Bring your own water service is spotty most times....and I've observed that we aren't always the only ones with empty glasses!We've liked Waldhorn for over 10 years....but this weekend was probably our last visit.
