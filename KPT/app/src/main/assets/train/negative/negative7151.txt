Unless you've been here before let me warn you about the unspoken house rules: 1. Order first (do not try and sit down).2. Wait for your food while standing.3. Find a seat (if one is available).Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full don't try and sit down without food in your hands unless you want to be made an example of.My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: you can either sit there or there with the tact of say General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the unwritten rules to us.  An excuse me but you need to order first before you sit down would have sufficed.So my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money.
