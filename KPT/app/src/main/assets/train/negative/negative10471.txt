I almost gave this place 1 star but hey the owners were very nice and cute so I can't do that reason as ratings need to be holistic. My friend was really craving Caribbean food so I did research on yelp and decided on this place because of the high rating. I was SOOO very disappointed. First of all LACK OF selections maybe this is an American thing to want to have a couple more options but to be fair you can see the menu that is listed under the photos section here you get like 3 choices. I got the vegetarian platter as well maybe that's why it's not very good. But I always prefer vegetarian and I've had MUCH MUCH better food elsewhere. I got some kidney beans mixed in with my rice...I feel like I could have cooked myself this with a can of beans dumped into my rice? On top of the kidney beans the veggie platter also comes with string beans...ok they are the best on the my plate. And then it was another selection of veggie that I am not quite sure what it is but this place kinda just reminds me of badly cooked southern food to be honest. But hey I am going to go back and maybe give it another try on the meat product. As far as veggies goes not tasty is for sure.
