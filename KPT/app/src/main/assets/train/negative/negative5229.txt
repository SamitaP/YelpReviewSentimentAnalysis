This place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers.  It may or may not be and some of the food is actually quite decent- I've had burgers and seafood and chicken and salads over the years.The reason why I rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal.  I've always felt like an outsider here even when we were going once or twice a week for months.  (We live right down the street.)  The hosts are terrible - it's like they look right past you if you're not one of their Special Friends and they shoehorn you into tiny and uncomfortable booths while putting smaller parties into comfortable and spacious booths.I'll go down the street to Lot 17 where the food is better and no one makes you show your Member's Card to get seated.
