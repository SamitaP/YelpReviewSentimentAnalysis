Maybe it's because I've been to New Orleans or have friends from Louisiana but I don't know what the big to do about Cajun Queen is.  Maybe it's because people have never had real Cajun cuisine before.The fried green tomatoes were blah.  The batter wasn't tasty at all.  My entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp chicken and crawfish.  The seasoning was weak.  I must say that the shrimp and chicken were cooked really well.  I just didn't expect a whole chicken breast to be laid over my plate.  The portions were good.Neither one of my two friends finished their plates.  One said her shrimp and grits were just okay.  My other friend said her fried oysters were fresh.I will not be going back.  Parking was hard to find and it was loud inside.
