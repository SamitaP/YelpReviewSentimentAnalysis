Their beers are really good I just wish the food was that great too. I ordered the bacon chicken mac and cheese which instantly got my mouth watering just thinking about it. I ate a little bit but I didn't want to finish it. Way too much pepper or spices and I could hardly taste the cheese. It would be better if they didn't label it as a mac and cheese because it didn't taste like that at all to me. It came with a slice of french bread on the side but it was plain. No butter on it or any on the side. Kinda weird.My sister raved about her hazelnut crusted chicken but I wasn't too impressed by that either. I ended up just drinking my dinner which is just fine by me! :)
