I've been going here since 2000 but never have fallen in love with it like everyone else. Maybe I'm weird. Maybe I've got a very sensitive palette. Maybe I'm just not average but I find Mama Ricotta's well below average and very very very salty.  I'm not someone who shies away from salt- I always have it on my eggs etc.  But it seems like recently everything at Mama's is over seasoned.  A lot of the dishes like the Pasta Primavera is very unremarkable so generally I like the chicken carciofi the best but perhaps because of the capers it is so salty I can never finish it. I went there for a business lunch (basically the only reason I'll go) and had a roasted beet salad. I thought I was in the clear with a salad but no- it was so salty too! A salad?? And not a nicoise salad?? It was very strange and it was very overdressed. Perhaps next time I'm forced to go maybe I should try a sandwich? The other complaint i have about this place is the service. One time recently the server was really inattentive. The second time the server was really bitchy (and it was a guy). I've never understood how someone who relies on tips is smug and rude. Anyway that paired with the mediocre food means I'm never going to intentionally go here. I'd opt for Fiamma Luciano's or Hawthorne's Pizza before here any day.
