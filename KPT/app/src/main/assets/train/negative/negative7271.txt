Yuck! I  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until I return. The wonton soup was watery and the wontons were inedible. I ordered pepper steak wwhich they substituted pork sparerib meat and I surmised that they didn't think I would notice. Also I think the health dept needs to perhaps male a visit;the place is dirty.
