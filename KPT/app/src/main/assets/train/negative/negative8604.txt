I visited Charlotte and decided to go here cause it was crowded. The wait was 35-50 minutes. I really didn't know what to choose --- so i end up ordering Beer Battered Fish and Chips (os os) and the ribs and chicken combo w/ fries (os os). There was nothing really special about the food. Charlotte doesn't have much to offer when it comes to food =P
