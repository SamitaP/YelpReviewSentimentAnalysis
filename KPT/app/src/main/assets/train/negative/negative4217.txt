When the bookends of your meal are the only strong points then you aren't going to score strongly in my book.  The salad was very good as were the breadsticks and bread with sea salt on the top.  As for the main entrees that my girlfriend and I had...let's just say they left a little to be desired.  The pasta trio sounded good until I heard that almost everyone had mushrooms in it.  Lidia's is definitely that italian restaurant that is trying too hard to be cutting edge.  Why not go with some standard italian dishes?  Their menu doesn't include really any.  My girlfriend tried to play it safe with the lasagna bolognese and they should have just called that a mountain of over-salted meat.  There couldn't have been more than two sheets of pasta and two tablespoons of sauce in that dish.  There is nothing worse than dry lasagna and if my girlfriend wanted to eat just meat she would have ordered just meat.  Lasagna does in fact call for pasta.  I ordered the halibut with polenta.  I'll start with the polenta.  Basically I should have just eaten my napkin because that had more flavor than the polenta.  The dish came with San Marzano Tomatoes Olives and Capers over top of it and water passed off as sauce.  Nothing annoys me more than when someone tries to go crazy with a fish dish.  Let the fish do the talking.  There were so many onions and capers on it that I needed to really dig for the fish.  The halibut was good but it's a shame that the piece was incredibly small because the rest of the dish was subpar.The desserts were very good however.  We went with the Tiramisu and Semifreddo di Cioccolato e Caramello (Milk Chocolate and carmel ice creams chocolate cake toasted meringue crushed toffee).  The decor was definitely cool inside too.  Maybe those light fixtures would have tasted better than the lasagna?Lidia's the trying too hard portion controlled spot in Pittsburgh.
