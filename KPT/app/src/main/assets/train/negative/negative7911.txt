I had been a fan of TR for years. Saturday was my first time back and I was dissapointed in the changes. The menu had changed greatly. They took away all the samplers of different ribs and the portions are much smaller. The price has gone up alot also. The ribs taste good but for the price it's just not worth me going back. I heard they were having a tough time thru the county but the changes made I don't believe will make them better.
