I really wanted to get grub at Price's but they don't have a dining area and I didn't want to get take out.Came here for lunch.  Waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved.  Free cornbread was average.   I had the fried chicken and sides of mashed potatoes and mac n' cheese.  Surprisingly none of it was really that good.  Service was cheerful though.I guess the best part was I was able to park in downtown Charlotte found a free spot and wasn't towed when I was done eating here.
