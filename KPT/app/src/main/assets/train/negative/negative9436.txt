Went expecting spectacular. Had been for lunch and had a great experience. Went for queens feast tonight. Got lobster Mac and that was good but never had Mac and cheese with cilantro. Then got the scallops she said it was a smaller dinner but it was a total of 3. That's right 3 for $30. And one was undercooked. My stomach hasn't been right since I ate it. Which they assured me was not undercooked. Figured they couldn't mess up Creme brûlée.... But it was room temp and runny. Oh well. Won't be back for dinner.
