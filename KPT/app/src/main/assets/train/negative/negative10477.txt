Given this place a few tries. The staff is always super nice but the food is a bit lack luster. The sauce does taste like it comes from a can and the crab Rangoon was chewy and soft like it had just been thawed out.  I ordered sesame chicken and I had two pieces before I discovered the long black hair going all through the dish. I was finished after that. This place is ok but I wish they would clean it up just a bit and take more care with how they prepare food. This was the last time I'll be here.
