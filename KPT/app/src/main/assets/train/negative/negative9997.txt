The other day I had been itching for a bagel and hoped since they had Bagel in their name that they would actually have perfected the bagel. Well not so much. They lacked the variety of bagels and Cream cheeses I am used to seeing. No Tofu Cream Cheese? Wha? Usually I can at least find a Whole Wheat Everything Bagel so that was lacking too. As for the line I'm not sure what that was about cause I think I could've gotten a better bagel at Starbucks. Guessing it was some of the other lunch options.
