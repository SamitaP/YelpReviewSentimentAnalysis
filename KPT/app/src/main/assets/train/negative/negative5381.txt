i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time. my fiance and i went with a couple who live in bloomfield and go to this restaurant every two weeks or so. We walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table. We stood near the host area for 10 minutes. Several employees including the host walked passed us over a dozen times and never said anything to us. Finally my friend asked how long the wait for a table would be. The host looked at us rudely and said I don't know 20 to 30 minutes. He was so rude and huffy. We left because of how unhelpful the staff was. I was excited about dining at this place before 10 minutes of frustration. We left immediately and went to the Thia restaurant down the street. It was excellent and they actually valued us as customers.
