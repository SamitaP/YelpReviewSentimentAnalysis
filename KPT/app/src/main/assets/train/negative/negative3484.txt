I was immediately displeased by the snaggle toothed hostess and her surly demeanor. The air conditioning was non existent which is a hangover nightmare. While waiting for a table the bartender ignored us for ten minutes and couldn't even transfer our drinks to the table. He also casually instructed me that one must pay per beer - duh! I'm not a beer drinking novice. The acne-ridden server was friendly enough but seemed forlorn and was overtly sweating. Bringing drinks to a table isn't neuroscience and I don't drink tap water. After sitting at our table for a few minutes it was very apparent that the entire serving staff is haggard. Appetizer - crab artichoke dip. Bland. Where's the crab? Also did a toddler arrange the plate? Apparently. Meal - fish tacos. Came quickly and surprisingly flavorful. However our server never once checked on our status and we had to beckon him to fulfill our needs. I shouldn't have to ask for napkins at the point of need. No tip never coming back.
