Civilized respectable locations don't charge separate covers for the gander and the goose.  Yes it's that simple.  Well Ri-Ra I used to be a fan of your Irish authenticity in terms of a cozy low-key beer every now and then.  But seems you have taken a turn away from legitimacy and towards masses of drunken revelrers.  A shame really for my once favorite bar in Charlotte.
