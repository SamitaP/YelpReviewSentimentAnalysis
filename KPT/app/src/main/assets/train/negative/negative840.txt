The front serves as a good Pittsburgh sports bar. It's a particularly great place to watch the Penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. There are lots of HDTV's and there is a good selection of beer. The food however is bland and is terrible bbq even for the northeast. I would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home.
