I've been here twice and I'm just not crazy about it.  Nothing is BAD per se just not really impressive.  The service is fine and the food is certainly edible but missing something - at least their vegetarian food.  When I ordered sweet potato fries a lot of them came out burnt.  The Big Green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks.  Their French onion soup was pretty good but when is French onion soup not good?  They have a hot vegetarian sandwich but it sounds gross.  Does hot hummus and alfalfa sprouts sound good to you?  As for non-vegetarian food my dad was very satisfied with his hot grilled chicken salad.I wouldn't mind coming back for brunch.  Since it's just around the corner from my new apartment I'm sure I'll end up going here with my parents fairly often.  I'm not crazy about it but if they're paying I'm not opposed to it.
