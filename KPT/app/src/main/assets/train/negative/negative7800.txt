The food here is subpar at best. When we asked for a kids cheese pizza they basically smeared some tomato sauce on a tortilla sprinkled a few strings of shredded cheese on it and with the way the cheese barely looked melted I'd estimate they'd popped it in the microwave for maybe 30 seconds. It's a shame the food is so bad though because the decor is fantastic and getting to take a tour of the kitchen before you eat is something you definitely don't experience everywhere. At least you know that even if the final dish doesn't taste that great it came from a clean kitchen.
