I never quite understand why some people look so miserable... especially when one works at a restaurant where people come and dine for enjoyment.  I haven't been to Thai House in a long time and this's my 1st visit to this location and they still manage to have the same unfriendly slow unacceptable level of service as they always had (the one at University area) and apparently known for... hmmm not sure if that's a reputation you want there Thai House.To use up a Groupon we had dinner there last night.  Amidst it's Father's Day it wasn't really that busy or crowded.  Somehow we still had to sit around for a LONG time before our order was taken... this was after a seemingly non-busy waiter walked by us numerous times and never even turned his head our way AND after a waitress ignored the heck out of my excuse me.  Food wise it was ok.  I had the roast duck with pineapple curry sauce while my dinner-mate ordered the Tom Kha (coconut brothy soup) and the beef Pad Krapraw.  The soup was interesting since coconut tends to be associated with sweet food items; I personally like it it's not heavy at all.  My roast duck was a little misleading considering it was more fried than roasted.  The meat was a little over-cooked but the curry sauce was good enough to compensate.  I had half a fork full of the beef Pad Krapraw... can't tell if it was good but this is normally my fav lunch dish (except I think it works better with chicken or pork). In all this is an average meal (food quality wise) but the service was  unbelievably bad.  When the most impressive part of the dinner is the decor (rich & ethnic without the tackiness)... well enuff said.
