Came here to try their famed burgers.  I ordered the gourmet burger and not bad.  However it was absolutely nothing special. I felt like I could easily make it on the grill at home.  Also the home fries were just mediocre.  I don't understand all the rave reviews for this place.  As for me I don't think I'll be back.
