Went here on Sunday. We don't usually go to chain restaurants simply because there are so many delicious locally owned restaurants in the area. However we had a gift card and decided to go have dinner. We got there around 6 and had no wait for a table. However when we left there was alot of people in the lobby waiting for a seat.We both ordered a glass of the house red. Well priced and very good for a house wine.I ordered the soup and salad with the pasta fagoli soup. My husband ordered the lasagna primavera from the lighter side part of the menu (it had spinach and veggies in it).Breadsticks and salad came out like expected. The breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more. The soup was very good and my husbands lasagna was even better. However we were joking that there is no wonder that the lasagna was on the lighter side. It was so small!! I guess we should have expected that given that making lasagna light isn't an easy task. I can't even begin to explain to you how small it was......AND normally we normally split meals at restaurants so we are typically used to smaller portions to begin with! Probably the size of half a deck of cards (width length and height) with like 3 small pieces of grilled chicken on it. He ate it and didn't complain....it was tasty though!Normally we skip dessert but when the waitress came by my husband ordered the pumpkin cheesecake (not sure if it was because he was still hungry or just craving something sweet!). This was SO good. HUGE slice of cheesecake. Very tasty and that slice was gone in like 5 minutes haha. Overall ok experience just wouldnt go back unless we had another gift card.
