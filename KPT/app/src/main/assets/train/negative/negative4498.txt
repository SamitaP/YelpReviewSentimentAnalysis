TOURIST TRAP. I found this restaurant online and my hotel room magazine. It had a pretty good number of reviews and apparently the first bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh so I added it to my Pittsburgh dinner options list. It turns out very few people in Pittsburgh or at least in our office actually knew this restaurant. It's an old tiny restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square. It's so old school they only take cash! The place is called  Original Oyster House but ironically they don't serve raw oysters let alone decent oysters! They only have these mediocre breaded oysters that you can have in your sandwich or by themselves. Everything else is average. There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that it was the first restaurant in Da Burgh as supported by the front door sign historical landmark. If you're looking for good oysters raw or not or simply a good restaurant for lunch or dinner this is definitely NOT the place.
