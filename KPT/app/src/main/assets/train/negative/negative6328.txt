Hands down the most disrespectful and terrible lounge in pittsburgh. Appalling service I went there with 6 people restaurant was empty and sat there for twenty minutes with staff walking by. The lounge was empty was there from 8-11 she didn't check on us once we had to flag her down  complained to the manager with no response. NYC prices as well very embarrassed for the big burrito company.
