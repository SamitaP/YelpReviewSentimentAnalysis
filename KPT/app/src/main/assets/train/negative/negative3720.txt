I had spaghetti warehouse delivered to my apt and I ordered spaghetti and meatballs while my boyfriend ordered chicken Parmesan. First off we both asked for Caesar salads (which we paid extra for) and we didn't even get them. Besides that the sauce was less than mediocre - a glorified ketchup with noodles. The chicken was dry and we couldn't eat half of the meals. Overall very poor experience with spaghetti warehouse. You're better off getting fast food noodles from noodles and company. Seriously disappointed especially since it is called the SPAGHETTI warehouse. Very hard to mess up spaghetti.
