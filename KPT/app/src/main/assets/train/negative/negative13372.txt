Not sure why the $$ this place is over priced and bad bland food. 12.95 for beef basil? They don't use real Thai chili peppers I like spicy and asked for it. They sprinkle Nasty old chill powder which ruined the dish. No flavor and not worth $12.95 Skip this place.Also called to let them know: response was  ok is there anything else I can do for you??????????Wow what rude jerks!!!!!!!
