I'm over it. Too many instances of bad service. Though that one woman who I have seen working there for a long time is solid. But going back to what I started with; seems like the inmates are running the prison these days. The beer to-go costs more here than it does in New York City or Brooklyn. Think about that people.(The Monroeville location is better imo.)
