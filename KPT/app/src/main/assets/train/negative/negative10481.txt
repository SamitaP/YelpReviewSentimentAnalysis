If I could give this place zero stars I would. I ordered the generals chicken because you really can't mess that up. This place did. The red sauce that covered it was so sugary and gross that it tasted like it came from a can.  There was definitely not any white meat in my dish--only chewy fatty tissue that had some dark meat attached to it. The side of fried rice tasted fine but it didn't have any of the usual carrots or peas in it so it lacked in flavor. I have yet to find a really good Chinese take out in Charlotte.
