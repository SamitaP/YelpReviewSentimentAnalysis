Hmmm..... where to start with this one. I'll go with atmosphere which was the good part. Cool sports bar pool tables and ample flat screens. Now for the not so good. Our bartender was a disaster- I rarely will ever say that I used to be one myself and understand that sometimes you can get overwhelmed or whatever other benefit of the doubt I normally give. But this was pretty bad. We sat at the bar with only a handful of other people so it's not even like it was busy. We told her were were going to eat and needed menus. My finacee asked for a Sunset Wheat beer which was on tap. We weren't paying attention to her as she poured but once he sipped the beer he immediately knew it was a Sam Adams. OK mistake. But when we looked over at the taps the two were no where near each other. We flagged here down when she returned to the bar (she kept disappearing) and she apologized went to pour the correct beer and only got a half a glass out of it. Just a minute she promised. Literally like 15 minutes later she finally came back but then ran off again before we could tell her we were ready to put in our food order. We were starving! We finally flagged here down and placed the order. Good thing we ordered when we did because the food took forever to come out!! By the time we got it we were SO hungry. I ordered the Mahi Mahi over rice and I wouldn't have finished it if I wasn't starving - the Mahi was really dry and they added so much spice to the dish that whatever flavor was there was killed. Granted it is a sports bar but I've worked in Sports bars before that served amazing fish dishes. If it's not going to be good it shouldn't be on the menu. After flagging the bartender down (again) we finally got our bill and decided that we definitely would not be back to eat but maybe just for drinks.
