Waited 45 minutes to get in at 8pm on Friday that wasn't the bad part though..Waited 30 minutes for our drinks (our waitress didn't even show up the host had to bring them) and after that 2 hours for our food. By time it got to us we were so sick of waiting and so tired since it was 11pm that we could barely eat. The food wasn't particularly good I ordered the chicken and macaroni with green beans. Chicken was dry green beans under seasoned and bland. The macaroni was good they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay. They got two orders wrong in our party of 4 though.The waitress apologized profusely and we received a discount for our wait but I will not return to this place again. TL;DROver three hour wait for mediocre food and poor service.
