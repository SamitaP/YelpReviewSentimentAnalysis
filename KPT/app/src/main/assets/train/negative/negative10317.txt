It pains me to say after Blue was my favorite restaurant for yeeeeears but spending 12 hours sick as a dog without  them doing a thing about it has forced me too.On Dec 18 2010 we sprang for an overnight sitter got a room at the Omni and a reservation at Blue (our favorite restaurant)  By the time dinner was over I needed to use the restroom and after that barely made it back to the Omni where I spent the rest of the night on the toilet.  I have eaten food from street vendors in Asia Africa and Mexico and have NEVER had a problem; yes I have intestines of steel.I called Blue the next day to warn them if nothing else and was told the chef is off but I will let him know  I never heard another thing.  I wasn't looking for a million dollars but I spent $400 for a romantic evening on the john.  Mistakes happen I am just disappointed in Blues lack of response or concern for a loyal customer.
