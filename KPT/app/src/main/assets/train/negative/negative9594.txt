Sauce by Chef Boyardee. And that is NOT a compliment. The evening started okay. We did not have reservations but we were early enough and they found a spot for us. The service was impeccable which is why this restaurant has been given 2 stars instead of none. We started with champagne. We did not want a full bottle as we were headed to the theater.   The house brand was on the sweet side but okay. Then they brought out the stale bread with the good white beans and olive mixture. The bean stuff was okay but it didn't make up for the lackluster dry bread. I expect so much more from a good Italian. Then we ordered the cheese plate and a sausage plate.   We only raved about one cheese. All of the hard salami choices were good but it is hard to mess-up that. Then came the worst main courses ever!  We ordered the pasta because we had heard such great reviews. I had the gnocchi and my friend had the ravioli. The pasta itself was good but the sauce ruined everything. We can only describe the sauce as a thin tasteless substance with a hint of the flavor that comes out of a can of Chef Boyardee. I only ate bit of this gruel. We called for the check.  The staff did offer to bring us something else but we were done. We paid the bill in full and left. We were so disappointed.
