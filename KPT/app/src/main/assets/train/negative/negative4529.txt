I am really disturbed tonight I ordered crab ravioli and I have kind of a special cheese culture allergy. Creams totally fine in small doses milk is too) so I ordered to the ravioli and said please no cheese it'll make me very sick. If there's no way to order this without just call me and I'll change my order. The pasta came smelling an awful lot like mozzarella) so I called and asked if the guy could check if the order had accidentally had cheese put in it. I mean I get things happen! The gentleman told me he didn't know what was in the food and I should look it up online. Then he proceeded to say if I was worried I should have someone taste it and snorted when I said I was dining alone. I'm upset and offended. I run my own business... and promote local business's constantly. I will be very sure to let everyone know this Pizza Parma.. believes the customer is not only not right but their health doesn't matter.  What a bummer. I used to be a big fan.
