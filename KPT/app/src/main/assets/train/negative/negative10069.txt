Don't waste your time. I came here mid afternoon to be greeted by an entirely empty restaurant. That should have been my first sign however I was in a rush and also in the mood for sushi so I settled. After having wandered over their meager beer menu three or four times I settled for something cheap...they don't carry local brews. Upon receiving my drink I ordered appetizers two for one the waitress told me and two sushi rolls on top of that. By the time my first appetizer was delivered the waitress told me that their sushi chef hadn't come to work that day so the sushi I'd ordered a good quarter of an hour ago wasn't happening.I settled with the two appetizers and when asked for the check which I also waited ages for the waitress had forgot to mark my appetizers two for one. So I waited again. I'd already informed the waitress that I was in a bit of a rush (had to catch a flight) and would have appreciated her concern.Anyways thats enough. I will say that though the bar and menu were limited during my visit the food that I did order was fairly good hence the two stars.
