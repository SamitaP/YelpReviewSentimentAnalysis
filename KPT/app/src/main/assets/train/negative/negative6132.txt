Food was good very average and just a bunch of rolls - nigiri and sashimi are kinda an afterthought. I wish the menu identified the ingredients. Instead I had to ask the server (really nice lady but definitely not quick and efficient - service was soooo slow) who kindly explained each one. I ended up choosing two and they were good more like meh good. Since I'm from SoCal I definitely wouldn't go here when I'm back in Pittsburgh again and would try to find another sushi joint.
