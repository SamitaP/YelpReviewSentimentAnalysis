This was the single worst Thai meal I have ever had in my life.I went here for dinner with some friends after going to the PSO since they were open relatively late at night.  This proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts.The first thing I ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup.  The listing of ingredients made it seem like it should be tom yum soup which is one of my favorite soups.  What I received was a bowl of dishwater-colored broth containing tomatoes so that it tasted like watered-down minestrone with some chicken submerged in shame at the bottom of the bowl.  A single lonely wilted leaf of cilantro wallowed on top.  No lemongrass was in evidence but there were plenty of mushrooms.  I stopped eating this when I unearthed an unsightly artifact which turned out to be the bottom of a mushroom stem with dirt still clinging to it.My companions both got chicken and stir-fried vegetables in what turned out to be Singapore curry sauce.  This was passable but not exciting -- again although it claimed to be lemongrassy there was no lemongrass flavor to be had and the chicken was a bit rubbery and overdone.I got one of the fish entrees.  On the menu the description made out like it was covered in a spicy sauce.  It turned out to be more like a not-at-all-spicy soup with bits of orange roughy floating in it.  Again the broth was lacking in overall flavor as if they were trying to save on costs by not adding enough spices.  The fish itself was at least not overcooked or dirty but it was a poor aesthetic decision to bread and fry the piece of fish then put the breaded coating into soup.  Gross.To top it off the service wasn't that great and we were actually charged for the dirt-filled soup.  We will not be back.
