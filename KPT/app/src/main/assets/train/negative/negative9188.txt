HORRIBLE customer service! (Not the waitress). The food was warm had little flavor and a simple menu item that read differently from what was expected was not offered to be negotiated. From where I'm from when something reads smoked turkey you are expecting just that not smoked turkey sausage (round slices of a turkey sausage). Even when given the pass of a misunderstanding the manager (owerners daughter as she so often identify herself) was more interested in making HER point than making sure out of state customers who went out of their way to visit the establishment....and checked-in on Facebook have an enjoyable experience. She was sarcastic & unprofessional. Sorry my family had THAT experience.
