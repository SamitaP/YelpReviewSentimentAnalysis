Took my boyfriend for first time.  Waitress kept going outside smoking and smelled like ashtray upon returning to table.  Cornbread good.  Chicken good.  BBQ was disgusting and swimming in grease.  Potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat.  I was embarrassed that I had bragged to my bf about how good things were and then had such a terrible experience.   And it was over $30 for lunch.  Not worth the drive parking or time.
