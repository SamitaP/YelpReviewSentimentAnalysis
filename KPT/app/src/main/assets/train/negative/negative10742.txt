I travel to CLT fairly regular on business. Went here with some co-workers and was disapponted. Waitstaff was not helpful with the menu. The food was mediocre at best. Had the paneer appetizer and it tasted like they were trying to make a McNugget with cheese. Sauces were tasty but now I wonder if they came from a can. If you really want great Indian food... Go to Copper. If you want McIndian go for it.
