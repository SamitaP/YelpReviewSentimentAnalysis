I actually really enjoy the wine bar behind the actual restaurant. Since it is considered a wine bar in that particular portion of the restaurant I would except more wine by the glass no matter the price. I would pay $$$$ for wine by the glass so I know I like it and then would pay $145 for a bottle.Then there's the main restaurant that I really wasn't that impressed with. We were sat at the table with the most slant...which there were other open tables for two with No slant. Our glasses were sliding down the table so we used our silverware to stop them from sliding. No joke! The food I ordered was penne alla vodka which was pretty tasty. But for $18 and that's all you get?! I've had better. The bread wasn't impressive just sliced up sour dough bread with not so high end olive oil. (You can taste the difference between a really good olive oil and a bulk cheap kind). Having said that I will certainly return to the wine bar for maybe a glass of wine and try maybe the pizza but not the main restaurant.
