I did some research saw great reviews for this place and decided to try while on a trip. I love fried chicken biscuts and potatoes so thought this was right up my alley.I went for breakfast.  The service was fast but bottom line I wasnt impressed with the food. I got the fried chicken biscut with potatoes.  The fried chicken really didnt have any great flavor or juiciness to it. Yes the biscuts were good. The potatoes were like tater tots. Not what I expected for breakfast and nothing better than the average tater tot. No ketchup? I went back and asked for hot sauce which made it all tollerable. It wasnt horrible it just wasnt great. If you're looking for great fried chicken I wouldn't say this is the place.
