I've been to Cain's quite a few times since I live right down the street.The best times I have had at Cain's consist of myself going into the establishment with the predetermined mentality of spending way too much for drinks ( $7.00 for a Jameson and Ginger!!??) and already being three sheets to the wind. Don't get me wrong if you like going to a place that mildly reminds me more of a mosh pit at times than an actual drinking establishment you would love Cain's. Definitely avoid going on the weekends.But I will admit that Cain's is an awesome place to post up at the bar drink a few beers and catch a Pen's game on one of their million TV's. Bottom line : This place is not a place where you and your buds can go and get poopy drunk at. Cains is at best a bar where you stop during a bar crawl for a beer and a shot. Nothing more and nothing less.
