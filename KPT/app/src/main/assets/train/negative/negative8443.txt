OK this current rating ONLY applies to the horrific braised short ribs that they unfortunately served me at dinner the other night! Usually they have pretty solid food and have a great beer selection. Went there with my work-mates in celebration of a major milestone and our big boss picked up the tab (which is always nice)!We ordered a bunch of appetizers lots of beer and then the entrees. Mine was the last to come out and when it did I said where's the beef? And I literally meant it. My braised short ribs were ALL BONES! Yes all bones with VERY LITTLE meat on them! And what little meat there was was chewy. As a foodie I am shocked that their Chef would actually serve something like that. I mean did he think I was an Irish Wolfhound who would gnaw on the bones???I had to come home to eat something as I was still hungry (not having any meat for this meat-a-tarian is brutal)! I sent their Management a message but have not yet heard back. I seriously doubt I will hear anything from them but I felt compelled to tell them that this meal was just AWFUL! Thank GOD for the good beers to drown out my disgust.Despite my anger at this RiRa still has the BEST Fish and Chips in Charlotte and again a wonderful beer selection. Just know that this one star rating ONLY applies to the beef short ribs dish and nothing else.
