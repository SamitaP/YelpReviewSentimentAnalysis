I heard from everyone that the Primanti sandwiches are the quintessential Pittsburgh food. We scored a nice seat outside and indulged in some Iron Hill beer that was on special for $2 for a  20 oz beer. The sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive.Be warned that everything here comes with french fries even the salads.
