I have to admit I've never physically been inside Fiori's but I've had their pizza several times. In a word: forgettable.The last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye. All the cheese was on half the pie. The onions were diced - an interesting choice - and I actually liked that they were raw. The green peppers seemed to have been cut willy nilly but that's OK. It's not 5-star it's pizza. The pizza has a sweet taste to it and I can't can't if it's the sauce or the dough but I suspect the former. Overall I'd eat it again but wouldn't go out of my way. I suspect it would be really delicious cold for breakfast.
