My wife and I had great service from Spring when we ate here a few nights ago. We always ask for either her or Tiffany. Unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that I ordered for dinner were foul. The steak was either overcooked or it was bordering on raw. Thank Gods for the fluffy buttermilk pancakes & hot maple syrup. Without them I'd have gone hungry that night.You might wonder why we continue to eat there given the plethora or marginal experiences well it is very cheap & its closer to the house than driving down to Carrowinds to go to Cracker Barrel.
