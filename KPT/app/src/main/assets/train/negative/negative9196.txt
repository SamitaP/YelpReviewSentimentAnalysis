Horrible service!!! Server forgot to put our order in. Came back 30 minutes later with lame lie. Another 20 minutes later still no food not even apps. Hostess also provided 2 new lame lies. We left and will never go back. Dishonest staff ruined it for me. Honesty would  have gone over better. Went to Tupelo Honey Cafe instead. Awesome service and FOOD!!
