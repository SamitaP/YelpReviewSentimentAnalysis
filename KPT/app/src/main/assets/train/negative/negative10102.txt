The lunch special at the Pizzeria Uno is a good deal so that must be why we keep going back even though we have terrible service time after time. Don't go there if you're looking for a quick lunch. The servers are usually absent-minded and it takes a while for your food to come out. The pizza is all right but as a Chicagoan it can't compare to the true deep dish pizza back home. If you go the flatbread quesadillas are a good dish to try.
