I had checked out the reviews on Great Wall south and decided to try it. Walking in at 3:45 PM there were maybe 3 tables occupied. The decor was inviting. I loved the huge fish tank they had on display. From there sadly it began to go downhill. A lady at the bar waved me to the dining room and a waiter sauntered over to ask what I wanted to drink. Also he asked me if I wanted a menu......strange. After getting settled with the menu I ordered 2 egg rolls hoping that since it was between mealtimes I would get freshly fried ones. Nope not to be. Cold hard and greasy. So back they went with a request for fresh ones told the waiter I didn't mind waiting for them.I ordered Sa Cha Scallops as an entree with a small pork fried rice. The new egg rolls came out at the same time as the entree. I could deal with that no probs. BUT....egg rolls were NOT fresh they were warmer and just as hard. Scallops were good and plentiful presentation was good fried rice was good also. The egg rolls were the turnoff. I'm giving it 2 Yelp stars but if you love good egg rolls don't come here expecting to find them. Panda's Den in north Charlotte puts this place to shame.
