I have been going here for many many years but on my last visit the food was terrible.  The crispy shrimp was soggy and the egg rolls had a horrible taste and smell.  I was told by the lady at the front desk they were homemade but that was incorrect.  I have had fresh homemade egg rolls and when you bite into them you see the fresh cabbage inside.  What Great Wall of China South serves is cheap frozen egg rolls.  I won't be back.
