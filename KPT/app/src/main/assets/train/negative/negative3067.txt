I must admit that not being from Pittsburgh I walked into this place with very different expectations for what a cheesesteak sandwich constituted. Having said that while the inclusion of an enormous amount of fries and coleslaw on the sandwich was great the tiny piece of beef patty that can only be described as something they use as a weight watchers/jenny craig portion leaves much to be desired. I honestly felt like I was eating some sort of vegetarian sandwich with a tiny piece of shriveled up beef patty lost somewhere in between the enormous slices of Italian bread.On the plus side the Oakland location does have a pretty sweet deal for after 10pm where a sandwich and drink was 3 or 4 bucks.
