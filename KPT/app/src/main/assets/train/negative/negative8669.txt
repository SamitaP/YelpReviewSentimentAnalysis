I have mixed feelings about Rock Bottom. I enjoyed the inexpensive beer sampler. The main reason we went  here though was for my fiance to try a specific burger. Unfortunately that burger was 86'd... as was her second choice. We weren't told that until 10 to 15 minutes after ordering which delayed our dinner. Otherwise what we got was OK. We went for a second time with some friends to watch a Panthers game and again it was just OK. i tried a third time and not only did our food take a long time but it was clear that mine was made first and had just been sitting out because nothing was warm. Three strikes and you're out in my book. I will not be going back. If you do go I recommend going when it isn't busy (as it was with my first and third experience).
