My wife asked me if I wanted to go to iHop tonight and naturally I said yes. I have to protect my dukedom. I ordered the country sausage potatoes pumpkin pancakes & grits. It will probably be good. Their grill guy is pretty consistent in turning out good food. There are quite a few people here for a Saturday night. Well the food was barely warm. Not an auspicious start to the meal. Cold grits aren't a treat. All in all I wondered why we bothered going.We went to iHop for brunch today 11/5/12 around noon & had Katrina as our server. It wasn't the best meal as far as service was concerned. I had to call her back to the table to refill my drink. Apparently my empty glass wasn't enough of a visual cue. The meal itself was average a bacon cheeseburger with fries and sweet tea. I don't think of iHop as a lunchtime destination and I probably never will.
