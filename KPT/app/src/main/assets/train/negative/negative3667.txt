Ordered take out from Christos.  I ordered a diet coke and it was in a cup.  THANK GOODNESS I took the lid off first.  There were HUNDREDS of large white particles in the diet coke that looked like paint chips  eggshells or paper and did not dissolve in the liquid but remained floating around.  This is a health hazard and needless to say I will not be ordering from this establishment again.  As for the food mediocre at best  The baklava was average the mixed grille kabab (chicken and lamb) was okay dry and chewy at times but overall edible.  The salad that came with the mixed grille was decent in flavor but did have some brown old lettuce in it.  As for the cold combination the tzatziki one grape leaf and hummus were fine but the tarmasalata had some ingredient which was clearly spoiled.  The cr√®me caramel (greek version of flan) was floating in water really strange texture; my guess is it was frozen then defrosted but a dessert should absolutely not be floating in a large pool of water.
