We were so excited to try Il Pizzaiolo after hearing about it from so many people and reviews online.  We discovered after arriving that they will accept cash only until further notice.  Apparently this isn't a temporary problem because I saw the same sign on the door a few weeks ago but assumed it was a one-night thing.  In the era of credit and debit cards being accepted everywhere (even McDonalds and 7-11) it seems inexcusable for a decent restaurant to make patrons withdraw money from an ATM before dining there.  I'm sure we will still try Il Pizzaiolo but at the moment I'm extremely annoyed with them!  We made the sacrifce and went to Bistro 19 next door.
