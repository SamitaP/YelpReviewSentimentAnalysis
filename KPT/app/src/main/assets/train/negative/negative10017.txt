I sat at the bar to try out Lavecchia's during Queen's Feast Charlotte's Restaurant Week fixed price 3-course menu. The atmosphere was nice & attentive. I didn't see the hostesses smiled once during the meal. Not sure what's up with that. I ordered the loster bisque grilled Atlantic salmon & chocolate layer cake. The bisque was lukewarm at best. The salmon was tasty & the only redeeming part of the meal. The chocolate cake was cold & hard. If this place is deciding to dog it for what is supposed to be a showcase week for restaurants that's pathetic. If that's just how it is here then that's bad given their price points. Either way I won't be coming back.
