Meh. I always hope for the best. I did not however get the best. Although I would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer wasn't bad. But I really don't think there's much you can mess up. The buffalo pierogies however was a total miss. I do not want to make any accusations but they did not seem to be freshly made maybe frozen pre-made ones. And they were covered in hot sauce. It didn't look appetizing nor did it actually taste appetizing. They have half off appetizer specials for food and $5 drinks. But all the special drinks were mixed and I knew they would probably be way too sweet and frou frou for me. I went with a glass of Malbec which was a good choice. Actually it was the best choice there. Maybe stick to beer or wine and you'll be good to go here.
