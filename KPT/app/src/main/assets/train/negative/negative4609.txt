I ate china house for dinner. I had the shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce combo that came with pork fried rice and an egg roll. I substituted steamed rice for the fried rice. I also got wonton soup (small). The price was great! For all of that and a can if sprite I paid 10.17! And the service was prompt and the lady in the front was very pleasant! Bottom line is the garlic sauce on the shrimp and broccoli was not good at all! It was very thick to the pony of sticky. It was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice. I could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross. The portion size was nice. The wonton soup was fine. Basically I will most likely give this place one more chance with a different item on the menu because of its proximity to my house and the great customer service. Hope I have better luck next time!
