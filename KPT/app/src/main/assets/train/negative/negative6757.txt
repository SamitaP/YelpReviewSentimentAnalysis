I cameHere for breakfast so When you first walk in I asked myself am I in the right place I was .... Starters food is nothing outta the ordinaryone funny thing that stood out was when we asked our server if they served any other meats aside from pork based meats she responded BACON! And no not turkey bacon... So clearly lil off there...  Other then that we order common breakfast .. Which was ok... I had the western omelette with turkey sausage ... The peppers and the onions were not sliced small enough and were overpoweringly huge ... Lil less On that lil more on the egg.. Which I wonder if the eggs were made from liquid base out of a carton ... Yeah so place was ok if u wanna eat in desperation ...
