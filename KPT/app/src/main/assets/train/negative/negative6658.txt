I had brunch here with two of my friends one of whom had brought her daughter with her.The bloody mary was COMPLETELY disgusting.  And there was no alcohol in it.  It was god awful.My friends daughter had ordered lox & a bagel and her bagel was ROCK HARD and cold.  We asked for a softer bagel and they brought one out.  It was the same bagel they just stuck it in the microwave.  My friend ordered a salad and it was all iceberg lettuce nothing to spectacular.I had a reuben and it was ok but I was so grossed out by the bloody mary I couldn't eat it.  The manager could not have been nicer he comped the bloody mary and asked me how I make them for myself when I'm at home since he didn't think his recipe was that great.  I'm still so grossed out by that bloody mary i'm never going bac.
