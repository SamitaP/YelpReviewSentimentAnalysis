Wow! If I could give negative stars I certainly would for this place. I wanted it to be decent because they have an ok draught selection and seating outside in the summer. That is where the positive qualities end. Food tasted like it came from a microwave - but that is actually generous probably actually came from Fido's dog bowl. This is an excellent candidate for kitchen nightmares the place looks straight out of the 80's and not in a cool hipster way either.
