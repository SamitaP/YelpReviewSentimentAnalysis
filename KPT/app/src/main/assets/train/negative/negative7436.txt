Took my Mom here today for a post Mother's day lunch. It's been about a year since our last visit. Salad bar is a one trip deal only and the salad plates are smaller than I remember last time. Hushpuppies are 2 bite sized and are very good with the right amount of sweetness and onion. My Mom got the senior flounder plate and I got one of the specials which was salt and pepper catfish fillets. Both included a side and the one trip to the salad bar.Food was good but both our flounder and catfish were on the thin side and not very meaty. Service was very friendly and attentive.Lunch set me back $23 with drinks tax and tip which I thought was really pricey for lunch especially with the thin pieces of fish and considering my Mom ordered off of the senior menu and I got one of the specials.
