Two and a half stars neither A-ok nor real bad. I was at Carolina Place around 1:30 pm and decided to give this restaurant a try -I was told it's the best Eyetalian in Charlotte.First the good part: I ordered the baked rigatoni with meat sauce and hot Italian sausage. It was excellent -if like me you like strong flavors and spicy both- nothing I'd expect from a chain restaurant. The lunch portion was huge too much in fact.that's it for the good.Service was absolutely dismal for no good reason. It was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch. I think the dinner prices are very high for Southern Italian style pasta dishes especially considering we're in Charlotte and I think their idea of family dining makes life easier for the cook but does nothing for the customer. My idea of fun dining is exactly the opposite I want to taste as many different things I can not pig out on a mound of carbs.
