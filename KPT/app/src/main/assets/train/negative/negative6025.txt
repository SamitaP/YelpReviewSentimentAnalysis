Ok...so it's difficult to give this a star rating as I had a mixed experience. The caesar salad is one of the BEST I have ever had but the pizza is one if not the worst I have ever had. I ordered the margarita sauce cheese and basil. Well I think they may have run out of cheese and basil. It was a wet tasteless mess. I may return if craving a good caesar.
