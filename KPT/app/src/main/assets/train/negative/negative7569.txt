Went for lunch today - and very upset that they now CHARGE a $3 fee for a basket of the pretzel rolls at lunch!Suggestion to the restaurant - simply ask each table if they want bread.  If they say no you save the cost of the bread.  If they say yes the bread is likely to be eaten.  The charge for the bread isn't worth alienating good customers.BTW we didn't have an inexpensive lunch.  Tab for four of us - including two glasses of wine one beer three after meal specialty drinks one dessert and the aforementioned basket of rolls - was over $100.  Did the $3 bread really impact the restaurant profit margin that much?
