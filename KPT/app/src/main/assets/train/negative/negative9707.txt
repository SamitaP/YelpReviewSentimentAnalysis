Meh...I don't get it. Brixx just didn't do it for me. A girlfriend and I stopped in Sunday afternoon. The place wasn't too busy and we were greeted with the good news that they offer $3 mimosas! The mimosas were good. But that's where the good stops...unfortunately. Yeah the prices were reasonable but I just wasn't a fan of the food. And for me I'd rather pay more to get better tasting food. I ordered the Americo pizza which comes with pepperoni mushrooms mozzarella and tomato sauce. I didn't like the crust or the sauce and it arrived lukewarm. Ugh. No thank you Brixx...I'll stick to other pizza joints to satisfy my pizza needs.
