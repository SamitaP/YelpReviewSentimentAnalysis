Meh is right on for this Quizno's.  Mmmm... Toasty just doesn't cut it when the quality of meats and veg served on the bread is below par on most visits.  Prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat.  A Lobster and Seafood sub that tasted like a Salt and Seafood sub.  Cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich.The saving grace.  When they have Clam Chowder as a soup choice it's actually pretty good!
