What happened to this place? I ordered my usual extra crispy sesame chicken and mushy yuckyness with  bland yet sweet syrupy sauce is what I received. I was given no choice between fried rice and white rice and they automatically assumed I wanted the large portion when I actually would have wanted the small if I knew I had the option ( I just thought the prices went up...and truthfully there was no difference in size and it use to be $6.95 now its $10.95!). I have gone to other restaurants and ordered $10 worth of Chinese take-out and received an egg roll and soup too- not the case here...although before it use to be- new management ?..or are they just getting cheap? The usually amazing   crab rangoon wasn't hot enough (temp-wise) and I was totally disappointed.They also forgot to give me my chop sticks which may be a small thing but I specifically asked for them. The literally gave us a full pint of duck sauce though so perhaps they should think of scaling down there and throwing in a veggie egg roll like they use to.  They use to have 5 stars from me but this last time wasn't even worth a single star in my opinion so  I'll meet somewhere in the middle and give them a 2.5 ...I really am not sure if I would return if the quality has gone that downhill...search is back on for good take-out Americanized Chinese food in Charlotte
