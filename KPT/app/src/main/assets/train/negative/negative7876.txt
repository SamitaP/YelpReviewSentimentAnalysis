Most people are aware that OG is far far from authentic...however it seems that OG has gone downhill in recent years and has left it up to a marketing team to save them. Upon our most recent visit to this OG in Pineville They gave me food poisoning. Having worked in the restaurant business for 15 years I am very aware of what food poisoning is and is not. This was the real deal..my first hint should have been at the restaurant when the couple seated next us were complaining about their food. I doubt we'll ever be back.
