Reservation for 2 on a Saturday made with ease.  Maybe a warning sign. Valet parking was easy as there was a basketball game so Charlotte was busy.  The jazz ensemble was playing when we walked in.  Pretty cool - so far.  It took me a while but I realized after a while that the inside of this place reminds me of a restaurant you would find inside of a Radisson in a medium sized city.  A restaurant that serves breakfast lunch and dinner - and mostly from a buffet (not that there's a buffet here) - I'm speaking about the (lack of) atmosphere.  It was also very loud.  I couldn't really hear the jazz band just a large amount of noise.  Oh yeah the food.  I ordered the Antipasti and my wife ordered the Pumpkin She Crab Soup.  Those were both pretty good.  My wife ordered a glass of wine and the pour was pretty minimal.  Look - we get it we're not going to make the restaurants night on liquor.  I didn't order alcohol and my wife only ordered a glass - but it was below the 1/4 full mark.  Pretty lame.  For the main course I had the lamb which is a specialty and my wife ordered the chicken stuffed with mushrooms and mascarpone.  We would never normally order chicken at a restaurant but glad we did.  It saved the meal.  It was really good.  The lamb however was a stew with veggies and such in a large pot.  It is as advertised.  It lacked a lot in the flavor department.  One word of warning.  If you get the sea bass it is filleted table side.  The couple (right) next to us ordered it and it smelled and looked kind of gross.  It kind of set me off for the rest of the meal.  Desserts were good.  I ordered the brownie topped with raspberry semifreddo and she ordered the salted carmel pudding.  Both were OK - but not awesome.  We also had to wait for coffee.  The service was ok but not great.  Our waters weren't refilled but once.  I waffle between 2 stars and 3.  I think the best way to describe it is we wouldn't go back unless some good friends really wanted to go there.
