The bagels here aren't as good as everyone said they would be. I actually think I like the Einstein's Bagel's bagel-cream cheese combo better. I personally prefer the plain bagel and cream cheese over the egg sandwiches because the eggs are kind of weird and microwavy tasting. The nice thing about this location is that it's on the 2nd floor of the epicenter and you can get there directly from the Aloft.They have some very good deals on breakfast bagels that are CHEAPER than Smoothie King. Damn you delicious expensive smoothies!Tip: I wasted $2 on a very very disgusting and watered down Iced Coffee. Avoid at all costs. Minus 1 star for that.
