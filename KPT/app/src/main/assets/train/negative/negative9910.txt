Disclosure: This review is based on St. Patrick's day bar crawl. So most places weren't on their A game for being slammed but then again they still get one star even with that consideration.So what went wrong?Tables weren't being bussed so we bussedMenus were sticky from spilled beerTook 15 minutes to order drinks then 15 more to get drinks and order foodFood took 2+ hoursAppetizers came with the food not before making the wait even more agonizingTater-tot nachos had very few chips and not much cheese mostly iceberg lettuceBurgers apparently only cooked well doneBurgers also come with toast in lieu of a real bunSeparate checks are too much work so we split the table 8 waysI have to stop the more I go the higher my blood pressure gets. It was really awful that day I wish I had just gone to Five Guys and been done with it (I ended up going later). Get your shit together. Oh and I still tipped the waitress most of that stuff was the kitchen. Should always tip cause they don't really get paid by the restaurant.
