I was fairly unimpressed with my food at Ri Ra... I ordered the lamb burger which consisted of an under seasoned overly large portion of ground lamb with a bit of feta on a bun.Ri Ra redeems itself a bit with a nice pub atmosphere. Although... a more unique selection of Irish brews would be a nice improvement.
