Walking into Jimmy Tsang's was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.Hot & Sour soup was highly americanized not very hot or very sour.Wonton Soup was a very large portion and good.Egg Rolls were large slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless not very good.Cheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.Chinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.Flaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.Tea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.The place was clean service was good prices are very good but the food was just average.
