I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small the place is small and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it as they use think rice instead of noodles but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall not impressed. I probably won't return.
