I've had better burgers at several other Pittsburgh restaurants. I have never eaten anything else on the Tessaro menu--and since it doesn't look very appealing it's not likely that I will--but the burgers are just OK. The service in my opinion is often quite rude. The ambiance is loud dark dingy and depressing. Sorry but I just don't get it. For a better hamburger try the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium Murray Avenue Grill or even Five Guys Burgers and Fries.
