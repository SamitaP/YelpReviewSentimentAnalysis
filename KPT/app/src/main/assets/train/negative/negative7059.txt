I really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews.  I love breakfast and I am a sucker for corned beef hash (I order it pretty much when it's on a menu).  Sadly I walked away from my meal with a meh feeling.First off I kept hearing about these pancakes I gotta try.  Well I figured what better way to experience them than to order a short stack right?  They were super buttery... Too much so.  I loved the thin fluffy texture and the crispy edges were a unique touch but those flap jacks were oozing butter (despite not using the included butter pat that comes with them)... It's all I could taste.  Too bad.  People generally recommended the stuffed pancakes... Perhaps this well teach me not to listen to the suggestions for the banana chocolate chip pancakes (next time).My real disappointment was that the corned beef hash was probably just a few points above the stuff you can buy at the store.  If it weren't for the large pieces of crispy potatoes or the sauteed onion... I would have sworn it came from a can.  Plus it was super salty and the meat over-ground... Kinda looked like pet food.  What happened to using chunks of real corned-beef and making the dish look like a hash?I'm a transplant to pitt and I'm still figuring the place out.  Nevertheless I'm still looking forward to trying some the other recommended food items... But... If you want really good authentic corned beef hash: Tasty Diner in Silver Spring MD.  Can't beat it.
