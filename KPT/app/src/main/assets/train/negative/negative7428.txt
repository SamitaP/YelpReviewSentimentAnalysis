SmellsGood service good food but the place smells like an old musty motel room. I'm local and have been there several times and it always smells. There's almost a needs cleaning public bathroom tinge to it as well. You'll know; stop where the little foyer ends about 15' inside the front door and inhale through your nose.It's an old place so it's time for renovation or replacement.
