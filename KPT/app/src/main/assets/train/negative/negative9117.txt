Let me first say how delicious the cornbread was!The catfish that I  ordered was a fillet with a lot of batter on it although it was seasoned nice it was just to much breading for me ( and i thought i was going to get the whole fish not the fillet). The yams were out of a can so that was a major let down. The mac and cheese was not to my liking at all it tasted like it was made with velvetta and other cheap cheeses.The fried chicken was lightly fried and not crispy either but the collard greens were well seasoned.Seems like a tourist spot to me. The staff was friendly and I liked the crowd I didn't get a chance to try the homemade cakes although they looked pretty tasty.I can at least say that I tried this place :)
