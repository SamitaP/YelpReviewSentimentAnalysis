My husband & I went here based on the reviews from here. We were in Charlotte for our anniversary and I was eager to try the local cuisine. I like trying small businesses and supporting them. With that said...Mert's was disappointing and overpriced. The fried chicken was bland you should not have to put salt on fried chicken. The Mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best. The fish had bones in it and one got caught in the back of hubby's throat. The greens and yams were ok. The WORST was the red beans; tasted like they were cooked in a caldron of hell. I got peach cobbler and could not eat it because it was disgusting!!! Horrible!!! If I go to a place especially a mom and pop and spend almost $40 for 2 dinners and 2 desserts it should be excellent. I have gone to mom pop shacks spend under $20 and got excellent food like grandma makes. I would not recommend this place and would never go back. I can't believe people like this food. It's too bad I have to leave this review because I love supporting small businesses and especially black operated small businesses. Yuck!
