Meh. I was visiting from NYC when I ate here before a show at the Brillobox. The beef pho was sub par. Food took about 10 minutes to arrive when it did the beef was already cooked through (that's a BIG no-no in my book). I could hardly make out the star anise in the broth and the bean sprouts had seen better days. The framed PPG review says Tram's has the best Pho in Pittsuburgh; if that's actually true then the state of  Pho in Pittsburgh is in bad shape.I also tried the vegetarian satay that my wife ordered and it was pretty decent so plus one star for having vegetarian soups and more importantly actually trying to make it good. It beat the pants off of the veggie Viet place on 6th st. in NYC. I kinda have my doubts about their interpretation of vegetarian though I kept that to myself...As others have noted the decor is kinda dumpy and the guy that took my order was surly but I wonder if there's some kind of inverse halo effect going on here. Some hole-in-the-walls are just that: a hole in the wall.Also: $8 for Pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing.
