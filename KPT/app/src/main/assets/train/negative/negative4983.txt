Trams has Vietnamese food and it's in Pittsburgh.  So if you're craving spring rolls with peanut sauce or vermicelli with fish sauce and fresh herbs this is the place to go if you're in Pittsburgh.  Be forewarned - if you've had Vietnamese food from places with large Vietnamese populations Trams satisfies an urge but it's definitely not the greatest.  They're stingy with the herbs and the peanut sauce; a bit on the expensive side for this kind of food (especially for being such a dive); the pork is dry; and the vermicelli bowls are pre-mixed - even the fish sauce has already been dumped in.
