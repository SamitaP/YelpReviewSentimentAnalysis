I didnt see anything spectacular about this place.   All I kept hearing about this place is the food ambiance and how its rank among the best in the country.   I'm more interested in the quality of the food than with all the glossy adjectives when describing the menu and service.  The bottom line is that I felt I donated $100 just to say I been there for food that was average.
