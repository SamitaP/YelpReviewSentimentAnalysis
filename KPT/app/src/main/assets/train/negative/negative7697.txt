I have been to many red lobsters before and usually enjoy the food. This was the first one that we have had to wait for a seat although it was not to long. This place seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. The food was not prepared well. The shell of the crab legs were spongy and bent with the crackers. The baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre. I will not be back to this location
