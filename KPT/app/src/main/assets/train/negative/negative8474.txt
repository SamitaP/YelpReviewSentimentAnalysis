I have always heard good things about Ri Ra's but my experience was nothing spectacular.  Ri Ra's is a decently sized (2 medium sized rooms) Irish bar is downtown Charlotte next door to Prohibition.  My group stopped in Ri Ra's to meet up with a few others and I was not impressed.  After paying one of the most unjustified $5 covers of my life I walked in and felt like I had just stepped in to an Ivy League frat party.  Suits sport coats and even tuxedos everywhere but this bar was nothing to dress up for.  The general vibe in this place was very uppity and i had several unpleasant interactions with people.  A DJ (who was actually pretty good) was playing blaring house music.  I normally would have really enjoyed the music but the crowd at Ri Ra's on this night couldn't have cared less about the music.  Dancing almost seemed frowned upon based upon what I saw.  Not saying that a few bad eggs are representative of the entire bar but on this particular night Ri Ra's did not live up to expectations.
