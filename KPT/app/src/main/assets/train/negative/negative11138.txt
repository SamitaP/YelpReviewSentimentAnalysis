I had high hopes for this place. Maybe it was because it was restaurant week but I was not impressed. The only good thing I have to say is the wine I had was excellent. Our waiter was lacking and did not explain the menu or specials. I had the goat cheese salad and it was good but did not blow me away. We we're suppose to get the sorbet between courses to cleanse our palate but it seems he forgot to bring it. When the main course finally came I had to ask for a knife and he seemed to have forgotten who ordered what so there was a lot of shuffling of plates. I got the trout and again I was not impressed. Dessert was the same nothing special. Maybe this place is good when it's not restaurant week but I am not sure if it's worth the price.
