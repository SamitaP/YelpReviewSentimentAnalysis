As much as I love the food here I'm sad to say this is likely our last time coming here. I realize that coming as a party of 5 on Saturday night without a reservation is usually tough to accommodate yet I was pleasantly surprised when the hostess told me they would move a table around and it would be about 10 minutes. We waited for 15-20 minutes and watched about 4 parties get sat before we asked what was taking so long since she had told us they were just moving a table. The hostess was very defensive and said that we shouldn't expect to get sat so soon without a reservation on a Saturday night so we asked why she told us it would be 10 minutes. She then said that she needed to seat people with reservations before she could seat us and completely refused to acknowledge that she had given us a misleading wait time. I understand that it's hard to guage wait times but when you're wrong you should simply apologize and not blame the guests for how they planned their evening. When we finally got sat our server Angel was very good and the Buffalo style salmon steak is delicious. I really like the food here but the fact of the matter is their customer service tonight was inexcusable. Even when the customer is wrong you don't blame them and say I'm sorry but... You simply apologize and try to defuse the situation instead of getting defensive and escalating the situation. If the hostess had simply said I apologize for the wait taking longer than expected we should be able to seat you in 5 minutes and thanked us for our patience there would never have been an issue. I love the food but I won't be coming back.
