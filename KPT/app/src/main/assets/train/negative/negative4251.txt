I was really looking forward to Lidia's.  And was really disappointed.  Bread was good. The cocktails were good.  The service was attentive and friendly (just don't get between a server dishing out the unlimited pasta and a hungry customer who clearly hadn't reached their limit with the unlimited servings).  Too bad the food wasn't good.  The beet salad was underwhelming.  I had the calamari which was rubbery and swimming in a tasteless chicken broth and white beans.  I felt even more sad for my dining companion who had such fond memories of the calamari.  I suspect such positive memories are no longer :(My other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy.  Another disappointment.   And thus my rating of Meh. Which is a huge shame.  But life goes on...
