I live a few blocks from Pamela's and each time that I walk by on the weekends there seems to be quite a few people waiting (and others have raved) so had been wanting to try it for a while. After waiting 30-45  minutes on a Saturday morning for brunch I wasn't that impressed. It is cheap the service is fast and they serve ample buttery portions of diner food. If you're not hungover I hope you have a good reason for going. You might as well just eat some grease and rub it all over your face.
