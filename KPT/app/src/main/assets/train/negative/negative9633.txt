A few weeks ago a few friends and myself rolled in here to check this place out.  I walked up to the bar and immediately ordered a bottled beer which cost about 4 bucks which I thought was a little steep. I then proceeded to glance around the bar and almost immediately realized that we had made a poor decision. I'm no xenophobe but a cursory glance of the bar area led me to believe that I was in the middle of a UN convention in uptown Charlotte.  I have no problems with gays and gangbangers as reviewer Jason L referenced but it is definitely not my crowd.The bar is undersized old dirty and generally an undesirable place to congregate.  Other reviews have commented on the attractiveness of the bartenders and I will not deny that but if your sole reason for going to a bar is for the attractive women that work there then I recommend going over to the establishment on E. Morehead St.Needless to say I will not be going back to this place.
