Let me start by saying I wanted to love this place. I've heard nothing but praise from locals. Tonight was my second visit and I can firmly say I am not in love.My first meal at MR was lunch with coworkers. I ordered a calzone. The crust was bland and the filling seemed sparse. I was underwhelmed but my coworkers raved about their dishes. I figured I should just order something else next time. C'est la vie.  Tonight a friend and I headed over to MR for dinner. I started off with bruschetta that tasted freshly made but had an overpowering acidic/vinegar flavor. The bread was already soggy like it had been sitting for a bit. My friend had calamari that she didn't care for at all.We both ordered slow cooked brisket (I think the waitress said about 7 hours.) with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes. The entree was good and the portion was huge...more than enough for two people. Leftovers are in my future. Of everything I've had at MR this was the best. Still I wasn't blown away by it. It was just good not great.On each visit the wait staff has been very friendly and attentive. Our waitress from tonight (wish I could remember her name) was super friendly and helpful. She did a great job.My friend and I weren't complaining about the food but our waitress asked so we told her what we though of it. And the manager came out to tell my friend the calamari would be removed from her bill and offered her a free dessert which was a very responsible and nice gesture. I was mildly annoyed because I don't think she even acknowledged my presence. At this point it didn't even matter. I don't see a return in my future. I don't eat a lot of Italian food but next time I'm in the mood I'm on to the next one.
