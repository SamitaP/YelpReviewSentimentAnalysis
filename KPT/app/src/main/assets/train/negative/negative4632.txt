The restaurant has a nice setting and pleasant decor but the food is seriously lacking.  I always know it's going to be trouble when the menu is excessively long... that says to me that the restaurant does many things but really nothing well.  And that's exactly what I got at Cafe Sam.  I had a pulled pork sandwhich that was bland dry and not particularly well put together.  My girlfriend had a similarly bland meal.  It was fine for lunch while we killed time waiting on the dealership to finish working on her car but I won't be back by choice.  Toast!  down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch.
