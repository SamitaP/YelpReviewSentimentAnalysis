Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues but apparently it's R&B night or Jazz night or something.  They play some old school CDs really loud so it's hard to maintain a decent conversation.  On top of that it's old school CDs bc the music would skip.  We asked them to turn it down (off) and their response was: It's R&B night.  Uh so who cares? Literally there was us and 2 old cougars sitting at the bar - that's about it. Note: We were not sitting with these cougars but the amount of times they were looking over at our table I thought it was feeding time - feeling like a piece of meat sheesh!  Hardly a R&B night if you ask me!  Beers were fine I liked the multitude of screens.  But it's so dead on Thursday bc of Jazz Night!  Just giving them a heads up let's trash that idea yeah? :)  Lol 2 other corporate dudes walked in was looking around saw cougars + music skipping and peaced out.  We totally should have done that.dmo out.
