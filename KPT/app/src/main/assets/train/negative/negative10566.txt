Maybe my standards are too high. I had high hopes for the breakfast biscuits here based on various reviews online but in the end they taste like frozen biscuits with various toppings. I had a chicken biscuit and the boyfriend had egg and bacon. Both biscuits had that sweet frozen/refrigerated/pre-made biscuit taste rather than a true buttermilk biscuit taste. If I'm getting chicken / bacon / other savory items on my biscuit I don't want the biscuit to be sweet! We also got potatoes which were good but they were nothing particularly special. In the end I can make a better biscuit and even the biscuit sandwiches from Bojangles are probably better than these (gasp). I want to go back to Art's for lunch soon because I really truly loved the atmosphere in there. The staff were amazingly nice it's a cute little place my order was ready quickly and I like to support local business. But the biscuits just don't cut it for me to try them again.
