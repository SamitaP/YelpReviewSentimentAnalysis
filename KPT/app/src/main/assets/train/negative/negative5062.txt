I was born and raised eating Pho and this honestly was the blandest I've had. Then to mask the bland no taste of the soup it was smothered in black pepper. On top of that my meatballs were quite dry even in soup.However their spring rolls were great!The service was not the best. We were seated and then grunted at (literally) to take our order. From there people who were seated after us had their food before we did. They had a very similar order to ours. Then when I did receive my food the man hovered near me and then started pouring sauce onto my plate telling me how to make my pho. I know how to make it! And even if I did need help I was barely just given my bowl and getting my bean sprouts in first. Give me a second.I had high hopes based on the reviews but unfortunately I don't see myself coming back here again.
