I've always enjoyed the food at Aquavina so it's a shame that the lunch service is so horrible. I've had several bad experiences (we just kept giving it another chance for whatever reason). Here's the worst: I along with a few friends arrived there to have lunch on a work day. Eventually the hostess returned to the front of the restaurant and seated us.Ten minutes passed and still no server. Then the waiter finally arrived and we said we were ready to order (because we had had plenty of time to study the menu). Then in a harsh tone he said We're really busy. Let me just get your drink orders. Um OK. Then several more minutes passed before we got our drinks and ordered our food. It took forever for the food to arrive. By the end of our meal we were the only people left in the restaurant and it still took a long time to get our check. One of my friends who is not a confrontational person even complained to the manager. He expressed no remorse and stared blankly at her. Then we finally left about two hours after we arrived.If you still want to try Aquavina I'd suggest you order the black olive encrusted chicken breast with macaroni and goat cheese and tomato compote. At least your food will be good.
