I was so excited to see a Thai House near my new job because I go to the Thai House University location all the time. While the University location is amazing I quickly found out that this location is anything but.The first time I ordered lunch I received a dish that was way too salty. I didn't save the leftovers. I ALWAYS keep my University Thai House leftovers for a second meal.I thought maybe it was a fluke and decided to give them a second chance.Ordered again today- even worse than my first lunch. My chicken pad thai tasted too sweet. Another yelp'ers description of it tasting like ketchup is not far off.  The noodles were overcooked and mushy. The spring roll is slightly burnt and the chicken rubbery. To top it all off the man who gave me my food had a bad attitude. Considering I was simply waiting for my food patiently no grumpiness was needed.  Never going here again though the other location I will continue to go to regularly as they have delicious food and super friendly staff.
