Closed on Monday's? And closed 5/30 to 6/1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted help wanted so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe.
