Horrible Food Horrendous Customer Service #overratedSo I already wasted 2 hours of my life eating at this place so I am not going to write a thesis as to why someone should not be a patron of this restaurant.  In summation when we arrived we were harassed by the owner (acting as the hostess) for wanting to sit in the corner served flat beer and then interrogated by her after sending an order back for not meeting the clear specifications given to the waitress.  Living in Latin America and traveling in Asia for some time I have been to a lot of hellholes but this is hands down the worst place I have ever been.  Not only was the food lousy and way overpriced but we were hassled by the belligerent sarcastic and condescending owner almost the entire time. Clearly customer service nor quality of food are valued.  Honestly I would rather starve than eat here again.
