I was here at the Pamela's in Shadyside a few weeks ago - dining companion and I were looking for a nice brunch-y place to visit. Naturally with all the high ratings we saw on Yelp! for Pamela's we gave it a shot.I have to ask: What is all the fuss about this place?My companion and I were a little dismayed to see it was a cash-only place but luckily in Shadyside there is a PNC just up the street. The restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables. It wasn't an uninviting atmosphere more laid-back but also a little indifferent if that makes any sense. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us.After perusing the menu for a bit the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast but that was sadly the best part about it.My companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate. The Greek dressing was saturated with lemon flavor way too tart and sour and the chicken was pretty paltry for the price.My crepe-hotcake thingies were okay but very oily and griddle-tasting. Way too rich to finish.Overall we found ourselves very underwhelmed with Pamela's. Our search for a good brunch place continues.
