I've been here quite a few times and I always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near Pitt. They have a ton of nice HDTVs.Everytime I go there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that I get. I was just there for the Pitt/Oakland game and got a Redhook. I drink this beer regularly and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).The food is hit or miss. I got the French onion soup last time. It was good. Nothing ground breaking but solid soup. I've had the pork nachos and they were blah.
