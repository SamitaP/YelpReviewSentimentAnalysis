After waiting in line for about twenty minutes our group was seated.  The place was completely packed.  It looked like someone's basement or garage with tables in it.  Various photos adorned the walls.  I tried the world famous hot cakes.  They were delicious except I only ate 1/4 of them since there was a very long hair wrapped around the hot cake.  Pamela's turned out to be a waste of money for me and I left hungry.There's nothing THAT great about Pamela's.  It's like breakfast at most any other diner.
