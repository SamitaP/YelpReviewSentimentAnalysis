I wasted nearly twenty bucks on the driest and most boring white pizza ever! The whole dinner was nothing but a downer. Plus the sample we got was way undercooked after eating the first slice we decided to bake it for another five minutes.Once reheated the crust wasn't bad not soggy or cardboard like but way thick for an alleged NY pizza. The topping unfortunately didn't get any worse or better for it it was as solid as it was bland.The only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than just one is that I suspect their plain pizza is better than average for this forsaken area. You've been warned: in Matthews-Stallings 5 stars amounts to just average out on in the modern world and 4 stars here translates to it's pretty much crap but we have no better .
