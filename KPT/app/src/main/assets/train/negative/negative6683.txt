Bad  very bad.    Ordered Gin and Tonic.....tonic water was as flat as water.   Returned drinks and ordered wine.   Wine was ok but overpriced.    Ordered an omelet which was basically an egg pancake with the omelet stuff dumped on top.     Home fries were undercooked.   Biscuit had overpowering flavor of artificial butter.   The chicken on the salad was entrenched with artificial flavor.    I think this restaurant does not use 'fresh' ingredients and buys a lot of things already prepared and all they have to do is 'heat things up'.    So their lazy way of doing things certainly has lost us as a customer.   Also....the waitress was wearing cologne or perfume...lots of it...her scent lingered on and on.   NO Server should be wearing a scent at work.   I would equate their food with a fast food restaurant.   Not a compliment.
