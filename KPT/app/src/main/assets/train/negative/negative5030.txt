Being Vietnamese I've had tried tons of Vietnamese Pho restaurants and Tram's has to be one of the worse place I've ever been to. The food was mediocre and full of MSG. I ordered a rice vermicelli dish with egg rolls and they were oily and greasy. The Pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty. My total bill doesn't reflect the price of the dishes I ordered. My bill came out to be higher than what's listed on the menu. Maybe because I'm vietnamese and being a visitor to Pittsburg for the first time they think is ok to overprice their dishes on a Sunday night. Although the old man at the place is nice this place doesn't deserve the stars that's given. I don't recommend this place to anyone especially my Vietnamese comrades whom may visit to Pittsburg looking for good authentic home town cooking.
