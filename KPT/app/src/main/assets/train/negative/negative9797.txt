The ambiance is deliciously dark and a throwback to the grand old days of quality tablecloths and real silverware.The service here was very sub-par.  Perhaps that was because I was dressed like an ignorant tourist that just wanted to be comfortable checking out the city---FYI--tourists have money to spend too...I hate the fact that most upscale steak restaurants ignores the needs of patrons who want to watch their waistline.My husband likes steak BUT--- I want to eat healthy.  So how about some healthy options Capital?  I had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk. There entree-sized salad was fit for a mouse that had already eaten...I  left hungry! Ugh.Plus---my special order came out wrong and I had to (once again) watch my husband eat while I fantasized about how many carbs were in the napkin...Oh I won't be coming back.  There are too many other great places to spend my well-earned money on.
