Food ordered:Drinks - Rhubarb Fizz Flying Dog PorterAppetizers - Potstickers and Lettuce WrapsEntrees - Dolsot Bi Bim Bap and Vietnamese Beef NoodlesFor $12 the Rhubarb FIzz was underwhelming over-iced overly bittered. Flying Dog Porter is a great beer. The Potstickers were ok but tiny while the Lettuce Wraps were the star of the entire dinner. Vietnamese Beef Noodles were bland and flavorless. The menu lists them as including jalapeno but there was no heat whatsoever. As for the Bi Bim Bap I've had this a few times at Korean restaurants and it was very... different. They essentially took the appetizers and side dishes and tossed them in the pot. The kim chi and pickled shiitake just didn't belong in the dish and brought a very off flavor to the entire things. It took a full dousing of the goju jang for the dish to be eatable. Very very disappointing.Service was ok. They asked how the meal was too many times yet after 15 minutes I had to flag down a waiter just for them to take my card so we could pay and leave.It was my wife's birthday and we took advantage of Big Burrito's GREAT free entree promotion but even with $23 worth of Vietnamese Beef Noodles taken off the check I still felt completely ripped off paying $80 for the rest of the meal and a tip. I'd much rather go to Noodlehead and pay $20 for a much better meal next time.
