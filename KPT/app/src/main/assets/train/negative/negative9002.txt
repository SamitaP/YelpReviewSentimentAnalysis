I rarely give bad reviews but this was a pretty horrible food experience. My cousin was in town today from Seattle and requested good soul food. I've heard good things about Mert's but have not had an opportunity to try. I figured it would be a good opportunity to show my cousin some good souther food. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The fried chicken was pretty bland. It seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long. The collard greens were insanely salty. Instant high blood pressure for sale! :( I ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard. I have to say that the corn bread was absolutely amazing which makes no sense that the rest of the food was so unappetizing.
