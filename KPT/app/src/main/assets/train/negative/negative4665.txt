Honestly the hoagies are fantastic but their service is appalling. I ordered two hoagies and received one and a half. After calling and explaining the situation Aaron the manager rationalized that their hoagies are large and could send another half depends on how hungry you are. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I have never in my life heard of such asinine customer service. The girl on the phone was really nice though...if that counts for anything. They just lost a loyal customer...never again.
