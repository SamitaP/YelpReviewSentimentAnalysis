I stopped in here with my family the day before Thanksgiving. My sister niece and parents were at the Children's Museum and were struck by a fit of nostalgia--my mom used to take us here when we were kids. Either the whole operation has gone severely downhill or I was too young to notice how bad it all is.Between all of us we ordered chicken Alfredo lasagna and cheese ravioli. Every dish had several things wrong with it. The chicken was likely cooked the week before in a dirty cafeteria then shipped to the Strip District. It was dry and looked reconstituted. The ravioli were lukewarm at best and my sister said the lasagna tasted microwaved. Even the bread was stale.Our waitress was also forgetful and a bit cold. I didn't get a salad I ordered dishes stayed on the table fifteen or twenty minutes after being empty and water refills were inconsistent. As a former server myself I'd like to think I know what is in one's control and what is out of one's control. This woman was simply not up to snuff.With Lidia's right down Smallman Street I have no idea how the Warehouse is staying in business. Spend a few extra dollars and go there. It'll be worth it.
