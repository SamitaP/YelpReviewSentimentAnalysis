On my first day working in CLT my team member raved about this restaurant and their daily lunch specials.Sooooo the Shrimp Creole in a nutshell is one of the Tuesday specials. Its pretty much rice (that's not cooked all the way) embryo shrimp (of the frozen kind from your local grocer) and red spicy sauce (umm creole sauce?). I tried my best but I could only eat a 1/4 of the plate and really that much b/c I was hungry. We were seated quickly and the food came in 6min....so I was able to make it back to the office ontime. Guess that's worth 2 stars eh?
