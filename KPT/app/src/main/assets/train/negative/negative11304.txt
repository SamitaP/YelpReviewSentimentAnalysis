They Lack favor in their food. I ordered the gumbo it lacked favor and good ingredients. it was not good. The popcorn crawfish were so delicious but covered in a mayo based sauce that should be served on the side. I didn't like seeing the stations for busing dishes right as you got to the top of stairs. It has potential but think the chef needs to take a hard look at his food. I want to love this place but the food is not executed well at this time.
