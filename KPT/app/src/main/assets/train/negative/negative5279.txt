With how Pittsburghers talk about Tessaro's you'd think it's the epitome of excellent all-American food.  But after having been here four times all I can really say is that it's very meh and very Pittsburgh.I apologize for the bland boring generic tone of the rest of the review but I'm not sure how else to describe the food here...The portion is 'American' and the burger was really thick and as juicy as I expected done medium.  As with any BIG burgers I like to cut it in half so it's manageable...and so I can still seem somewhat ladylike.  The first half of the burger was OK/good/no complaints.  The second half just seemed to lack flavor...  I guess during the first half I was just hungry but when you calm down and taste the order it was so bland.  I mean of course I could taste the mayo/ketchup/mustard but the actual meat part was just flavorless.  I was really disappointed by that...I ordered potato salad as my side and it was good/OK too...nothing to call home about.In all honesty I would've rather had Five Guys or In-n-Out burgers.
