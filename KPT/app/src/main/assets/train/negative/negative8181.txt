I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark food was good and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat knowing this is her regular spot I said Alexander Michael's!Parking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend hold hands and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  The food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the crab soup was made with fake crab which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat which was average. Tender enough not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later I felt that their menu was limited a little overpriced and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.I will give it a 2nd chance and visit again maybe not anytime soon.
