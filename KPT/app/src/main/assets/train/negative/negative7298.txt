my husband and I went there for dinner this evening and while their bunches are usually lovely I don't think we will return for a dinner meal again.I ordered the steak mid-rare and asked for a Caesar salad for my side... the salad was terrible bland the dressing was barely there and i really question if it was actually a caesar dressing. The parmesan cheese tasted old and well sorta like it had been shaved off the block of cheese ages ago - it was sort of rubbery and bland as well. My steak was more medium than mid-rare and they included a peppercorn sauce which sounded good on the menu but had far too many peppercorns in it and ruined the dish... the mashed potatoes were really good once i picked out the peppercorn overload seeping into it. The broccoli served on the side was barely steamed and seasoned with some surprising and awful seasoning. Completely disappointing.  My husband's salad looked much more appetizing... baby field greens and ranch dressing - he was happy. He asked for a shrimp alfredo which they did make special for him (they have it as chicken alfredo on the menu). I tasted the sauce and it was ok but very thin and could have used more cheese to add more flavor as well as thicken it. He was happy with the meal but admitted to me that Girasole's alfredo was much much better. So no I don't see us heading back anytime soon for anything other than perhaps a bunch meal. I will say that the service was excellent - the waitstaff was attentive and friendly and they did a great job but the food is overpriced for the quality of preparation.
