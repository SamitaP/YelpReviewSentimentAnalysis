Stopped in after the theater for a pint but could not get served. We sat down at one of the tables ( more or less stood by it because it needed cleaning) & waited for a server. One did walk by our table to grab the tip from the table behind us then walked back by our table but we were invisible. I then asked the bartender if we needed to place our order with her & take it back to the table but she said servers were on the floor & they would take our order. So we again waited & never did see a server. We gave up & went elsewhere for our nightcap.
