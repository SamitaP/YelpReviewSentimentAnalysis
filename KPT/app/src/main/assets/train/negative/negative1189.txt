I've been back to Quiet Storm many times. I can accept the hit or miss service since it's pretty cheap and casual. That's not really an excuse for bad service it only somehow softens the blow but why be mediocre? The environment is comfortable (unless you sense the servers don't want you there). The music ranges and is appropriate for the environment. It's never too loud or aggressive. Free wi-fi helps and the milkshakes are slammin! The food is inconsistent but often good. The Black-a-dilla is my favorite. I really want to like Quiet Storm but it only merits 2 stars. Their food service and hours are inconsistent. It seems they often close early. Owners please stick to your business hours. It's not like you're open that late to begin with! Perhaps everybody wants to go home I don't blame them for that and you may have run out of a few things but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away.  OR If you believe this is an acceptable business practice it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to '9am - until we feel like it.'  This way there are no set expectations and we can't really begrudge you for it. ...My vote is to just stick with the hours you created.Thanks!
