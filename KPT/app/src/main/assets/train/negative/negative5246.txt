I'm always trying to hit up places that are listed in the fantastic book Hamburger America. Tessaro's is one of two places to be listed for Pennsylvania. I visited while in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago with high expectations. I like the joint it seems like a family run business and there's a lot of people coming and going. We didn't have to wait long for a table and the service was fine. I do like the atmosphere but I just had so many better burgers that I just can't rave about this place.They don't have a frier so your burger comes with home fries or potato salad. This wasn't bad but I really love the classic combination of burgers and fries. Maybe it was an off day. I know they have their own butcher who works in house and that is exciting. But the burger wasn't memorable at all.Bottom Line: I've had better.
