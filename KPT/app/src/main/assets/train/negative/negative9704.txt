I came here with a group of friends before going to the Checkers game a group of 6 people. We were sat in a booth that was a little cramped but the place was busy so we didn't mind. Being an after work event our group got there in 3 waves. From the time we sat down until the last person got there was probably 10 minutes. The waitress was so impatient. As soon as the last person sat down she came over and asked if we knew what we wanted to eat. Well... yes some of us that had been there knew but the one who just sat down (my husband) had not even had the chance to look at the menu. From there it only went downhill. I got the impression she was angry with us because she was just not very nice. She didn't come back to the table after that for 20 minutes. I got the Fresh House Made Mozzarella Sandwich and it was just a sad sandwich. It sounded so good but the ingredients were wimpy. There wasn't enough tomato (which were not ripe) to cover the bread and there were maybe 2 shreds of onion. There was nothing fresh about it. I also ordered an Angry Orchard Cider (not on the menu) which I had to ask if there were any ciders. The waitress did not say the price but beware they are $5.75. Too expensive in my mind for that drink (but what could I do at that point?). The location is convenient but I would much rather go to Queen City Q.
