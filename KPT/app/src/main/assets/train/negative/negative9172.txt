I spoke with Veronica the general manager. She apologized profusely for the mix up and assured me that she spoke with the staff. Ultimately there was confusion about who was responsible for our table. She indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice.She invited me back to the restaurant. Based in her response I will give them another try and hopefully add more stars. I was so disappointed because I was hungry and really wanted to try the seafood omelette.
