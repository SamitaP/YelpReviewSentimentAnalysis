We stopped in here for Dinner and it must have been an off night for them. I ordered a coke when it came it was very watered down. I commented to the waiter about the coke and his curt reply was I know I get complaints about it all the time but nothing I can do about it. I ordered a hamburger and when it came the bun was stale and the meat tasted freezer burned. While we were there the table next to us was complaining about the food also. Like I said maybe just an off night but we won't be back.
