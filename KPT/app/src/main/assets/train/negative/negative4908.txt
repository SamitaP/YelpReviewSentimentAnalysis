If you wanna see local color come to D'Amicos. If you wanna get a stiff drink in the middle of the afternoon while walking around with a bandage on your face and wanna fly under the radar (true story) come to D'Amico's. This place is absolutely no bells or whistles the waitresses are loud and the stale sent of grease and old liquor hangs in the air. All the way down to the cracked teal vinyl seats this place is legit.  D'Amico's just don't give a s**t.But it's all good. Having traveled quite a bit I often find placees like this refreshing. The Wedding Soup is comforting and they are generous with the bread. And....they have no judgements about the previously mentioned strong drink that I consumed at 2:37pm on a Friday afternoon.
