Let's just say I swore I would never go back here again.  After 5+ years a friend that loves it talked me into it.  I got the Chicken pot pie special and I would say it looked like baby food.  It was a pur√©e with half a bottle of pepper on it.  The side salad tasted very bitter and it would be safe to say I only ate 50% of my meal because it was hard to stomach any more of this food.  For a better review talk to my friend because he loved his chicken sandwich.  Unfortunately it will have to be another 5 years before I try it.  NO VALUE.
