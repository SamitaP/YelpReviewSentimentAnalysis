I don't generally like to review restaurants that I've only eaten at once since that hardly seems fair to me and I will be up front I have only eaten here once but I'm not in a terrible hurry to repeat since I've found better Chinese which is closer to my house.We went here on my roommate's request. He had the Chicken and Broccoli (He ALWAYS has the chicken and broccoli!) and seemed to enjoy. We split an order of crab rangoon and it was pretty decent too. It wasn't exactly complex in flavor but it's tough to screw up crab and cream cheese deep fried in wontons. I had a General Tso's combination and I can best describe my impression as underwhelmed. The chicken was a little to crunchy/chewy for my taste and the sauce was not as spicy as a like my general tso's but I suppose these are both excusable if they happen to be your taste. What was not excusable and really what is prompting me to write this review was the egg roll. The only reason I was craving Chinese so badly was because I wanted an egg roll. You know how boiled cabbage can be kind of odiferous? Well imagine a wonton wrapper which contained nothing (no egg no pork no nothing) but cabbage that smelled not mildly of parade route (anyone who has ever marched behind mounted cavalry knows what I mean). I was very disappointed.It should be said that the service was good and as I said before I have only eaten here once. You can pay your money and take your chances on the fact that I was there on an off night or that they will be more to your liking. I will be getting my Chinese food elsewhere.
