Eh.. I had the chicken alfredo; the noodles were hard the sauce was thin.  Boyfriend had steak au poivre which turned out to be brown gravy dumped over the steak. Interestingly the steak was actually really good. and the gravy was good too but brown gravy over steak does not make it steak au poivre. Not their fault but their credit card machines were down for like an hour... they did comp us drinks while we waited though. So let's make that a 2.5 stars.
