In sum we ordered take out here a few days ago. There were bugs in my egg drop soup. Nuff said.Usually I write these long reviews. Not today. I ordered two orders of soup Hot and Sour and Egg Drop. I only eat the Hot and Sour the night we ordered our take out. I specifically ordered the Egg Drop to have for lunch yesterday. Fortunately for me- I noticed the bugs prior to eating. Looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup. Disgusting.
