Smells like wet dog.  EXTREMELY humid inside.   Food was good (the two stars worth).  Service was very bad today.  I am a server myself and I would be beyond embarrassed if I provided such poor service to a table.  Added bonus - It constantly seemed like she was trying to rush us out.  Delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking!!!  Also delivered our checks before we were halfway done and we had to ask to have a desert added on...
