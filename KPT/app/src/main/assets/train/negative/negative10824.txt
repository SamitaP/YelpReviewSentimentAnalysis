When you eat the real deal I guess you're a lot tougher.  I had laksa there.  VERY ho-hum and way way way too large.  No reasonable person can eat a huge soup like that and since when is laksa supposed to be that soupy?  And....unfortunately....it tasted...well....prepackaged.  Their other Asian cuisine isn't bad.  I guess for Charlotte it's a bit of an adventure but I found it rather generic.
