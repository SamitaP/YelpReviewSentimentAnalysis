Seriously how many F words can you not use on a Yelp review? How do you order app a salad and three entrees.  Salad came first then bruschetta (wtf) toast and tomatoes and cheese.  Don't give it a sweet name and take 50 minutes to make it.  Also the fact that we order lasagna and you are out of it?  You couldn't tell me that during the 50 mins that you were making bruschetta?  How long does it take to make lasagna?  Wait someone told me longer I'm sorry I didn't go to culinary school I guess nether did your cooks I use cooks loosely.I would recommend a better Italian place but I'm Scottish I would say stay home drink beer and make macaroni and cheese!
