I guess when you grow up eating authentic Indian food the bar gets set pretty high.  Maharani was not at all what I'd hoped for.  The food was bland under-seasoned and the woman working the door seemed not to care much that we bothered walking in.  The decor is old and drab the entire place having a rather sad mood.  Someone needs to wake up update and start cooking with passion.Life is too short.  Go elsewhere until that happens.
