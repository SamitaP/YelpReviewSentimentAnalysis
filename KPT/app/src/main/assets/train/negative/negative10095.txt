In the tradition of full disclosure I never really liked Quiznos that much anyway....I'm more of a Firehouse or Harris Teeter Hoagie guy but the other day I was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try.  The Roast Beef and cheddar looked pretty good.  But it wasn't.  It had a weird sort of taste and with every other bite or so I would notice these odd little mushroom bits...you know like the canned mushrooms and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking.  Not to mention the after effects....uggggh...never again Quiznos....never again.
