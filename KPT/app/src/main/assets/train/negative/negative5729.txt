Hi Every Year since I moved here to Pittsburgh since 2003 we went to the Getaway for St Patrick's Day. 3 years ago the food was terrible but upon taking the extra order back to the restaurant the next day the owner was very nice & refunded some of my money & promised next year would be great! It was as he said Great but this Year was so disappointing my family & I will never go back! The staff was very nice but we waited 20 mins for a table as we were seated at 6pm the waitress asks us for our order & 2 out of 3 of us had our heart set on the traditional Corn beef n Cabbage dinner her reply was we are out of that for a while now! That info should have been given to us before we waited to be seated so we could have gone elsewhere and My dinner was Irish Lamb Stew I counted the lamb pieces in that stew I got 4 tiny little chunks so I paid for mashed potatoes & lamb gravy it was terrible and expensive. Avoid Them on St. Pat's Day Band was Terrible as well!
