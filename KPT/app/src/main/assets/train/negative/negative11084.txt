I had dinner at Carpe Diem with a good friend on a recent Tuesday evening.  The company was excellent but the dining experience wasn't something I am eager to repeat...  First the atmosphere.  Others have commented on this already but I really didn't care for the decor or the atmosphere.  The lighting doesn't really work - the restaurant is too bright - and the furniture and flooring just really aren't up to snuff for a restaurant that's going to charge these kinds of prices.  Truth be told the place reminds me a lot of a funeral parlor... Yeah I know.For an appetizer we ordered a salad - priced over $9 - and we told them that we were going to share it.  They split the salad served it on two plates and charged us a $2.50 split plate fee.  You're kidding right?  The salad was good but not even close to being worth the nearly $12 that they ended up charging us for it.  My friend ordered the Mediterranean sampler from the appetizer menu and she enjoyed her food - and I am at least glad for that.  My entree the scallops served with risotto was fine but overpriced.  For $24 I received three scallops on a bed of risotto.  The risotto was undercooked.  The flavor was fine but for $24 the risotto should be better than average - especially when there are only three scallops.  To me this is quintessential high end Charlotte dining - decent food that is absurdly priced.  If they had charged $8 for our salads and $18 for my entree... it would have been a reasonable value.  For what Carpe Diem charged though I just found myself wishing that I had gone somewhere else.
