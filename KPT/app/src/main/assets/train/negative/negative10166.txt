This place is downright bizarre.  it's run by the same people who run Greek Isles which means most of the menu is Greek with some pasta and creole items.  I say creole because there is like 2 items on the menu that are supposed to be New Orleans style and those at the tables around us who ordered the special (chicken creole) left most of it on their plate. I had a caesar salad and it I kid you not comes out in a mixing bowl.  it's huge and really a total waste of salad because it would take 3-4 people to finish one.  I barely made a dent in it.  The salad was just alright nothing terribly impressive.  During the week it's full of blue shirts watching ESPN.
