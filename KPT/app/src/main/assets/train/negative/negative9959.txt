Tried Chicks for lunch a few weeks ago and was not impressed. The 2 staff working were very friendly but the fried chicken sandwich is clearly just a frozen fried chicken patty brought back to life in the deep fryer. It was alright for a quick lunch but defintely not worth the 4 star yelp ratings that initially convinced me to try it out. I haven't been back since.I'm pretty sure my high school cafeteria serverd the same fried chicken patty sandwich...
