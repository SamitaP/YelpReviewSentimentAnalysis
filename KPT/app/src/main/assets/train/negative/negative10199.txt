I used to love this restaurant and have brought out of town guest there for dinner in the past years but this restaurant has gone downhill and should no longer be in business.  My last visit was at lunch with other work colleagues a couple of weeks ago.  I ordered Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  When it arrived it was pretty obvious that the Ahi Tuna was old and on its way to being rancid.  I was appalled that any real Chef would ever serve anything that looked that bad.  I was in a business setting where I did not want to make a scene so I ate only the vegetables and did not touch the Tuna for fear of getting sick.  The waitress never ask me if there was anything wrong with my dish even though it should have been obvious to her that I pretty much left the fish untouched.  If you're Uptown do yourself a favor and go to Halcyon Mimosa Grille Ruth Chris or Bernardin before going here for lunch.
