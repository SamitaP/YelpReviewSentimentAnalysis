Disappointing. My bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine which we told the hostess ahead of time. The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). She did not offer suggestions or advice.We ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.The waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it.
