:( ok i don't want to judge all atria's by this one. in fact i wouldn't even judge this atria's solely by this one experience. but let me tell you i was highly disappointed.i will point out the good parts of the night first. we arrived to see a band play. the entertainment was great didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person) and i liked the set up in the room where they played. also the soup i got (crab bisque) was delicious!ok now for the rest of the experience. first of all our service was AWFUL. i don't know our server's name and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault as there was a large party upstairs. but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks another 15 before we even got them. ten more minutes before we could order our food and after the meal we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain. i saw him checking on other tables and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy. as a server myself i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt but it really got to be too much. the one thing i will say for him though was that he was very nice. but for how much we waited we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complain.the rest of the food and drinks were okay. good but not enough to make up for the service. i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eat.i'd try another atria's before i'd go back to this one. but now i'm weary of the restaurant all together.
