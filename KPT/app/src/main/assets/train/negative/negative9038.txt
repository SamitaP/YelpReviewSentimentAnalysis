Had the Shrimp Po Boo.  I wish I know that it would be spicy I would have asked them to hold the spice.  Even the Home Fries where spicy.  I understand that it's southern home cooking however other items on the menu warn that it's spicy.  I understand it's not a four star restaurant however the batter on the popcorn shrimp could have more crispy.  Perhaps the fryer was not to temperature when they sunk them.  Despite the spiciness of the potatoes they where fresh and not cooked that long although personally I do like crispy home fries.  Having said that portion was good size price average with other restaurants in the area.  Service was my biggest issue.  While the waitress did keep checking back to see if we where ready to order however she never asked if I would like another Ice Tea.  I needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention.
