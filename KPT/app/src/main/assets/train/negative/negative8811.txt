I came to Charlotte for a business conference and was so excited about going to Ratcliffe for dinner - I'd heard great things.  I am a vegetarian and was pleasant surprised when I received a confirmation call for my reservation where the woman asked if there were any vegetarians in the group.  I said yes and she said they would be happy to cater the menu however I wished....which is why it was so sorely disappointing when I got to the restaurant and the waitress said they could only offer me grits veggies or mac & cheese.  I said I'd be fine with a plate of grits with veggies plus a side of mac & cheese.  Then 30 minutes later a different waiter brings out just a plate of vegetables for me.  I asked if there was anything beneath the veggies (thought they could possibly be covering the grits/mac&cheese) and the waiter very rudely said does that look like grits to you?  I told him what i'd ordered and said he had no idea what I ordered and marched off.  Then the waitress came back completely shocked and annoyed saying she thought i'd wanted veggies...blah blah.  Eventually they brought me something but they were just sooo rude.  It was my first time being treated like that in an upscale restaurant.THEN the host came out and asked what was wrong and all he could say when i told him was sorry to hear that NOT I'm sorry about your experience then he awkwardly pulled his head up until his neck turned fuschia then walked away.  Nothing more.I got the bill for the side of mac&cheese and side of grits - they charged me $20.  I was actually trying the place out to possibly bring the rest of my company for an all-expense company dinner the next night but that definitely did not happen.  Will NEVER go back to that place again.
