I recently dined here for my anniversary and was deeply disappointed by the service.  Placed in a high traffic area; dirty dishes left on table; drinks not re-filled; server  not familiar with menu and special pricing; Did not get order right; I have expressed my concerns to Landry's and to the restaurant directly and have been ignored.  The service here does not match the high prices.
