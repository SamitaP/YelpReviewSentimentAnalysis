Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.We parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!Perfect. My mother got the Lobster Roll which she said was 'good'. The bread from Mancini's was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty no doubt  I mean lobster is just - good. For the price though not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair) way too much horseradish and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!And it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So needless to say not the best experience.Talk about false advertisement...
