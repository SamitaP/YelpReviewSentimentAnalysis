I wish zero stars were an option. I placed a delivery order and was told it would take 30-45 minutes to arrive. After waiting for 90 minutes and placing three calls to the store my food arrived. When opening the bag I had a feeling this food wasn't worth the wait. My beef/broccoli was chewy cold and unappetizing. I ate a few bites and tossed most of it in the trash. Do not eat at place and whatever you do don't get their takeout service. Go to Tapei Express on Providence for great Chinese takeout.
