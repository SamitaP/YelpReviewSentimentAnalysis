It's been a minute since I lived in Pittsburgh but I frequently return to attend events and visit close friends from school and work. I think Pittsburgh has absolutely wonderful food and I truly became entranced with the culinary scene while attending Carnegie Mellon and checking out local fare. Luckily for us CMU kids Shadyside was a hop skip and a jump away. Therefore it was naturally the perfect neighborhood to dine and shop.I had the opportunity to attend two group birthday dinners at Girasole. Both times the food was authentic. The place itself is very small and intimate so it has a very nice cozy if not bordering on claustrophobic feel. That is not the impetus for my review. Both times I have dined here the customer service was intolerable. A moment that I will never forget in all my life was at my birthday dinner when the waitress came to our table as we were about to leave and said to our group (my friends who had graciously paid for my dinner) why is the tip so low? What was wrong with my service? My friends had left this woman at least a 15% tip. I will never forget this publicly humiliating moment for the rest of my life. This should serve as a reminder and a stark warning for all who work in customer service (as I have myself) that you should never ever do something as atrocious as what this waitress did. There were so many alternatives to how she or the restaurant itself could have approached this but I truly believe she acted in the least responsible most alarming manner I have yet to see from anyone who holds a job. That is the prime reason why I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
