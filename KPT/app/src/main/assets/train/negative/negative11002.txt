Cherry House is good for two things: quick and inexpensive Chinese food. Don't expect to be blown aware by culinary complexity or innovative dishes and presentations here. But hey they carry most of the westernized classics.US CULTURE TIP ON THE USAGE OF THE TERM CHOW MEIN:I learned from my experience here that there is a difference in the US between East and West coast conceptions of chow mein. On the West coast (where I was raised) chow mein refers to the steamed soft noodles and Hong Kong style refers to the crispy style fired noodles. However here on the East coast chow mein is assumed to be the crispy Hong Kong style while lo mein refers to the soft steamed style. Who knew?At Cherry House however chow mein seems to refer to a bunch of fried rectangular morsels of friedness. I think they are the ones that you find in soup sometimes. In any case I was a little let down.That said in a fix it is a perfectly viable option. The lunch combinations are a fantastic option at $6-$8 for main dishes with fried rice and egg roll spring roll or crab rangoon. A filling lunch for two coming in at under $13? I've had worse.
