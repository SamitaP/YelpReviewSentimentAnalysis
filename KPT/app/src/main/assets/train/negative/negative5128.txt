This was some of the worst food I've ever had.  If this is someone's idea of nostalgia nostalgia is a term I'd like to forget and the reality is more like nausea.  Their greek soup (tasted like Campbell's chicken noodle flavored with lemon) and nasty lamb gyro douched with cucumber dressing will likely haunt me as long as I live.  For anyone looking for a good nostalgic diner experience i can't make a recommendation because I've yet to experience one but at least in this case leave the past where it belongs.
