I don't know what all the fuss is about.  The cornbread is good but they are stingy with the butter.  (one little container for four small loaves).  The servings for the kids meals were ridiculously small and they burnt the outside of the chicken fingers!  My kids would not even eat them.  Another big problem.....parking!  Charlotte is not getting locals into downtown on the weekends because you have to pay to park everywhere!  I called the restaurant before going and asked where to park.  The person told me we could park for free in the Holiday Inn parking garage.  Not so!  We had to pay $8 just to park for lunch!  All said we spent $60 for soul food!  Rice and bean shrimp creole one kids plate of 2 chicken fingers and one kids vegetable plate.  Also kids meals did not include a drink and they charge $2.00 for a child's drink.  It was hot in the restaurant loud from the voices of other diners and you couldn't hear the music.  This place is not worth the price.  I could have prepared that food several times over for what I paid in that restaurant!
