Great atmosphere of a neighborhood pub good German beer selection but food was less than mediocre.  Won't be back. Weisswurst was very bland.  Sauerbraten was dry and tasteless.  Spaetzle was well not tradidional German Spaetzle.  Schnitzel and purple cabbage  were the high points but then again it's hard to screw up a fried veal cutlet.
