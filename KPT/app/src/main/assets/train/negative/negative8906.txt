I am so sorry to rate Mert's so poorly but after the treatment received today I must admit to extreme disappointment in one of my previously favorite Charlotte establishments.  After being invited repeatedly via automated email marketing I decided to go with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday with lunch at Mert's.  After the most interesting discussion (!) with manager (?) I discovered that I did not have the necessary proof to rate the birthday deal in spite of having a valid NC driver license clearly showing my date of birth.  In today's economy I was stunned that any food establishment would take such a tack with a good paying customer!  No worries on seeing my dollars at Mert's ever again.  To many restaurants want my patronage.-cheers
