I ordered a Veggie Pizza with 4 different toppings and did not really enjoy it a lot. They use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza. Also the toppings were not greatly blended just rather sprinkled. DIdn't even enjoy the pizza crust.I work right next door but wont go there again.I usually dont write reviews. Was surprised Yelp had 4 stars and I was disaoopinted so writing my experience.So sharing my input that may help others make an uinformed choice causeI think 4 stars is misleading.
