A disappointing experience! I have been to Rock Bottom several times before this trip. The pizza always seemed decent and the microbrews were okay too. Nothing special but the location and atmosphere has always been nice.The insert menu excited me when I got here...Oktoberfest...was here. I love German food and I love Oktoberfest beers. I mean...love...really love Oktoberfest beers. The German Burger: half a pound of meat with some cabbage mushrooms Swiss and ketchup....on a fresh pretzel bun. Sounds great right? Wrong! It tasted like a big meat patty...no flavor...nothing! Just plain boring.The Oktoberfest Sampler Platter: Some type of Knackwurst corndog...which tasted pretty much like Pronto Pups at any northern state fair...not bad...but not warm in the middle. The fried corned beef and cabbage things were nice...but seemed pretty Irish to me. This also came with a fresh Bavarian pretzel with a variety of mustards...nice.Now here we go! Rock Bottom describes their Oktoberfest beer as Full-bodied with a classic sweet flavor Rocktoberfest is an award-winning Oktoberfest-style beer that is rich with a toasted malt character and finishes with a subtle crisp hop.Now...if I was allowed to swear here...I would. In what world this beer is toasty malty finishing a tad hoppy...or award winning is beyond me. This beer is Budweiser with some caramel food coloring. This beer had no personality whatsoever! I can say that it finished nicely...by having no taste at all. Great job! I'm glad a terribly sub-par meal only set me back sixty bucks...I'd probably need a second job if I decided to eat somewhere with good food.
