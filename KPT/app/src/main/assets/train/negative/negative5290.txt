I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a lemon of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers Sysco meat or at chain restaurants then you would find this to be amazing.  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics but definitely above average especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades.
