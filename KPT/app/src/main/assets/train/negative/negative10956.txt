This is not a review about Papa Johns in general.  I love their pizza.  This is a review of their store.Terrible!  Terrible and incredibly rude staff terrible service terrible manager and the worst part terrible pizza.  The last time I ordered from them the pizza wasn't even edible and the cardboard broke when the driver handed it to me because the grease had leaked completely through during delivery.  Twice they've gotten my order wrong and they don't do anything to make up for it I've had an employee hang up on me before even telling me the total for my order or asking if it was delivery/pick-up and they don't honor the coupons online at papajohns.com.  Go to Domino's if this is your Papa Johns for your area.  I don't even like Domino's and order there now because this place disgusted me so much.
