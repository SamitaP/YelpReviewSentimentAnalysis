I can't really give a food review since I didn't order anything but there is a reason why I didn't order anything.My brother and his friends had the midnight munchies after the whole pub crawling. Being the responsible little sister I chaperoned the boys and went the Ritters with them. I wasn't in the mood to eat after midnight but that's not the reason why I didn't order anything. The reason why I didn't get anything was because when we walked in the diner I looked at the variety of dishes other patrons ordered and felt slightly sick to my stomach. Must've been my inner conscious that the food is bad news and I guessed correctly. My brother had the Arcadian burger and by sunrise his stomach didn't settle well. Had no desire to eat throughout the day.Trust your eyes nose and instinct. It's most likely right.
