I've been there twice and they have yet to impress me. The decor is old and dingy at best the seats are gross and the carpet looks to be 30 years old and identified to my grandma's. My biggest issue was the food. I just assumed that a sea food restaurant would serve fresh fish but I was sadly mistaken. Every meal I or friends have had here was poorly prepared greasy and clearly had been frozen for an extended period of time.The only plus side of the place was that it was dirt cheap but be prepared to get what you pay for.
