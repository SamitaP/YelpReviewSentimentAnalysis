Visited this place for the first time for a rehersal dinner. The decor is cool and varied and the place itself is quite large. There is free parking which is nice but parking was hard to find on a Friday night. We had a semi-large party (about 15-20 of us) and it took us well over 30 minutes to get seated. Clearly they knew we were coming so it shouldn't have been a surprised to them.Once we were finally seated it took 30 minutes from ordering our drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) to actually getting them to the table. We still hadn't even looked at a menu when the drinks finally did arrive. From there the service picked up slightly and we were presented with warm bread garlic butter (decent) and salad. I dislike iceburg lettuce so this was meh. Given that we were a large party obviously we were given a limited menu selection. I ordered The Incredible 15 Layer Lasagna and it certainly wasn't 15 layers unless you count the loads of marinara on top as say 10 layers. My cousin ordered the same thing and ended up with a piece of chicken on his plate don't ask me why. The lasagna was okay but I've had better from a Stouffer's frozen meal.Moving onto dessert I ordered the tiramisu. Might as well just call it white cake with espresso drizzled on top. It was still slightly frozen too. No thanks.From start to finish it took us over 3 hours to get our entire meal. Understandably we weren't a small table of four so it will take longer but it shouldn't have taken that long. Since we were there for a significant amount of time we were able to observe what other's were eating/doing while we were waiting. Nearly everyone had enough leftover portions to take home and feed themselves at least once if not twice more. Good value as a customer bad for a business who is trying to make money.All in all if you're looking for some good authentic Italian I would recommend going elsewhere.
