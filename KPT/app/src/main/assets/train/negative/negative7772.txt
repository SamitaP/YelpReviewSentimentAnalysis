I have to give Buca di Beppo props on the ambiance they create.  You cannot find another restaurant like it (or if there is one - I am not aware of it).  For those that are not familiar with Buca di Beppo it is an Italian restaurant that serves family style meals.  Any dish you order is meant to be split between members of your party - so if you have a party of 2-4 you really only need to order 1-2 dishes for the party.  Me being the picky eater that I am I would rather order my own dish than share.  At least with this experience did not have the best server.  He did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job.  He was willing to split the bill among the five people in our party but one person in our group ordered an alcoholic beverage and the price of her drink was split amongst the people in our party.  They might only do this if there are people in your party that have not eaten at Buca di Beppo but when they take you to your table they walk you through the kitchen (which has a table for patrons to eat their meals at).   The only plus side of going here for meals.
