Had the chicken sandwich  my sister had the guiltless chicken. 30 minutes after ordering our waitress came over to ask again what we had ordered because she had forgot to put the order in. Food was flavorless plain. Was there a few nights ago for drinks after the game waiter wouldnt allow 3 of us to sit at a 4 top table (but had a party of 1 sitting at a 4 top right next to the table we were going to sit at). Do they even have tables for 3?? 15 minutes later... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there. Overall its a close spot to PNC but given both experiences wouldnt return.
