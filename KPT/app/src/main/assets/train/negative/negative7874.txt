My mother wanted to take my wife and I out to dinner for my wife's B-day we were a party of eight we were assigned two waitresses that had a difficult time getting on the same page. Wrong order wrong drink refills and it took 1:49 from the time we placed our order until the food reached the table. A member of our party stated a food allergy he had to order twice and still received food that contained his stated allergy. Upon notifying the manager we were told not to worry the check was taken care of and he apologized. He suggested we dessert as well which took another 34 minutes and arrived with the check. Upon leaving we had to walk by the rear of the building were the waitress and manager were talking and over heard her complaining about us when confronted the manager apologized again and returned inside. Needless to say we will not return to this location again and I would suggest that you do the same. We were not the only ones with a grievance as several other patrons were given gift cards and comped bills.
