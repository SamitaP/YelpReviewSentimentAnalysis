UGH.Nasty restaurant with nasty food. I can thank BK for ruining my dining plans this past weekend. Sometimes when you have kids you have to eat somewhere to appease them. I used to only go to BK if I was stopped up and needed a release. Well that's still definitely the case after eating there Friday night since I made intimate friends with my commode both Saturday and Sunday.This place is filthy. The food is atrocious.The employees are miserable (one of the cooks....No. the ONE cook was dressed in street clothes-whatever happened to uniforms?).Your palWalter
