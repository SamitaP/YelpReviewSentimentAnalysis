The food here is okay (2.5 stars)and does not completely satisify your appetite. Every time we have eaten here we were hungry shortly after. Go figure. Well the service here on the times we have visited has never knocked our socks off. Just okay. Very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy. It is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food. The garlic knots and calamari are consistently tasty. Not a place we want to run to on a regular but good enough for a snack.
