I really wanted to like this place.  It had cool old wood signs and their original menu on a chalkboard and friendly welcoming staff.  The menu has a lot of good sounding items but the problem for me was I was expecting some good Southern cookin with chicken fried chicken or chicken fried steak.  So I went for the fried chicken breast and it was just blah dry and no flavor.  The saving grace which earned the extra star was that the side veggies were good and the cornbread was delicious.
