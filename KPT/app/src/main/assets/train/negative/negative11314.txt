Visiting Charlotte from Los Angeles while husband is in town for business. The good: The upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere. People are talking loud and enjoying themselves. Have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time. We each had a glass of wine. The sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal. Not the shrimp the sauce with bread dipped in.The bad: Food is mediocre. We had the Cajun popcorn which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce. Good but on the salty side. Tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead. The sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place uneaten. We each had a cup of seafood gumbo There is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo (yay!) but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless. We ordered a large order of the barbeque shrimp and I got a side order of grits. The sauce in the barbeque shrimp was spicy and delicious; dip the bread from your bread basket in this tasty broth. The shrimp were on the small and limp side; not memorable at all as far as texture. The final insult: the grits. Grits are a favorite food of mine. I'm a southern girl and make real deal bomb-azz grits at home. The grits at Cajun Queen were those instant add boiling water to reconstitute grits. Culinary blasphemy.I will not return. If you want real grits go to Mert's Heart and Soul.
