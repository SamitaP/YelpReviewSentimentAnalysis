This brueggs kinda sucks. Every time I've come they are out of multiple kinds of bagels so someone isn't doing their counts correctly (use to work at a brueggers). The service is lousy. Also apparently brueggers discontinued sprouts-not this stores fault but wtf?! Sprouts are awesome. Going to Poppy's next time.
