This place blows chunks.  I would have given it just one star but the waitresses are fab and cute.  The whole place smells like it has been through a flood and instead of getting the place cleaned properly they spent the insurance money on new cars.  I have had the wings here..blah and the veggies are gross with brown tips on the celery.  Yuck.  It is a huge space and has cool giant tvs so if I was just here to watch the game and drink it would be okey dokey.  There are a ton of places to watch the game though that have great food...sigh....
