Very confused by this spot.  When I lived up town (2012) I remember this place being very different.  The location is so so amazing so I hope they really step their game up. They are right across from the brand new park Uptown.  They advertise their dishes to be comfort food with a touch of cajun but that really doesnt come through at all.  It is simply a Greek restaurant called French Quarter.  Having said that they do have very good daily lunch specials and numerous local beers on tap up at the bar.  I have stopped in here a few times for a quick lunch while at work and ordered the chicken tips.  The best part was the gravy.  Everything else... so-so.  -Ian M.
