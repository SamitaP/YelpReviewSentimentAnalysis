I really don't understand the hype of this place. To be honest had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city then I would have probably rated it a 3 or 4. The pizza was just OK. It was decently greasy and the crust wasn't all that special. They wouldn't deliver (Even though I am literally a few blocks from them) and they don't accept credit / debit card - a huge downfall for me.
