I am not a fan of big corporate Italian-style chain resturants and the OG is one of my least favorites (behind Maggianos Macaroni Grill and Bucca di Bepo). I would never choose to go here over a locally owned place but unfortunately there are times that I find myself at one of these types of places for a work or social event planned by someone else.  That is how I ended up at this OG location.  There were about 15 of us and you would think a big corporate chain like OG would be well versed in serving large groups but on this particular visit the service was even worse than the food (which is not very good in my opinion).The service was PAINFULLY slow and the server(s) kept forgetting to bring items to the table.  It took forever to get drinks to the the table.  Then  I had ordered soup with unlimited salad & breadsticks... as did several folks at the table.  With so many eating salad it was gone in no time and it took forever to get more to the table. A couple of people didn't get their entrees at the same time so awkwardly sat at the table waiting for food.  This attempt at lunch ended up taking  2+ hours - which is ok for a dinner event but completely unacceptable at lunch time when you have to get back to work.  The bad service coupled with the mediocre food just makes this place a big waste of time.  Next time someone plans an event here - lunch or dinner - I will just have to respectfully decline.
