I've been to Soba Lounge before three times before actually and all three times I had a good meal but my last visit was so unfortunately and unequivocally terrible that it felt necessary to share the details of our meal. For appetizer we had the kimchi pancakes which were not fully cooked. They were doughy and sticky and when we informed out waiter he agreed with us that it was not fully cooked but made no move to return the dish to the kitchen until we requested that it be at the very least warmed up to a degree in which it was actually edible. I had the sea bass which was mediocre and somehow different from the other wonderful times I had ordered this delightful dish - it lacked the explosively delicious flavors. The curry that was ordered was the worst - completely and wholly NOT recommended. The rice was tough (probably not fully cooked once again) and the spices were arbitrary to the chicken itself as though they were thrown in after the chicken was already cooked. Given the price of Soba dishes the bill certainly took a plunge into our wallets but sadly with no degree of satisfaction for our taste buds or stomachs.
