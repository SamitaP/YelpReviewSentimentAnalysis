I have been coming to this location since 2006 when our office relocated to this area. I have always enjoyed excellent service from the staff and management. I visit at least 2 times a day. One thing I couldn't and still can't  understand is why they continue to have the turn over in staff especially management. These are people who make your day and have brought a smile to my face whenever I've had a bad day. I would hire any number of them at any time. I have driven past other locations just because I enjoy the atmosphere and staff at this location. No longer. Their most recent management change has left the place without a soul. It's a change that you can sense  and see ( they did  some lite remodeling)  when you walk in the door. This was the day after her abrupt departure. This individual was always here to fill in for staff or to make sure the place was taken care of. She was here in the snow storm this year. Amazing right? I'm a bottomless member and got ten people from work to buy them from here bc I enjoyed this place and it's service. I will not be getting one next year and doubt I will frequent as much in the future. It's not the same! As I'm wiping down my own table to sit down it is quiet and lacks the laughter  smiles and business I have always appreciated. A lesson  for senior management and owners to take to heart. Take care of your most important assets your staff! I hope to see a turn around but in the weeks since the change I have seen only one thing a decrease in the service and quality I've come to expect. At this time I can no longer promote this place as one I'd recommend to friends or coworkers
