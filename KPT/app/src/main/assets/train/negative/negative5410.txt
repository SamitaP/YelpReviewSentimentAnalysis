Food is great but the service at the bar is horrendous. Last few times we have went the bartender was unable to cope with even a half full bar. Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front  bartender told us yeah but we would have to come inside to order things because it's too busy. There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table  so it's got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn't want to be seen. Classy. Same one was working the last time we went  it was dead and she still couldn't keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with give me a second I have to get this for these people first  and then she would look at her phone. I mean I don't expect the best service on a Friday night somewhere but when it's dead and you can't even come close to keeping up what the hell are you doing. On the bright side we got bread with our meal for the first time in the last four visits this time so....  progress I guess. The food really is great especially the mafalda but man the service has gotten to where it isn't worth it.
