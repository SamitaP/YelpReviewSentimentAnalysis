Came here about 4:30pm looking for a happy hour and some appetizers at the bar. There were people at the bar so of course we sat down at the bar.   Someone could have told us when we first walked in they were not serving food yet.  So we left and then came back because of all the great reviews.  Sat at the bar again and shared some appetizers.  All 3 over prices and all 3 just okay.   Living close to MD i guess it as a mistake on my part to think the crab cake would be anything medicore but saw it was crab and lobster so we gave it shot.   And still disappointed.  This is what we had-Provence style lobster and crab cakes finished with basil oil and a citrus beurre blanc. Provence style lobster and crab cakes finished with basil oil and a citrus beurre blanc. and their were 2 the size of quarters.   Pop and they were down the hatch!   And they were 13.00!  1 star.Next Arrancini-Risotto balls stuffed with pancetta onions and motz with tomato sauce.  These were bigger and their were 3.   These get 2 stars.  Then last we had the jumbo diver scallops.  Again-2 for 12.95.  And they were just okay.  2 stars.   Lemondrop martini was great!  And serivce was a little slow for an empty bar.   something tells me there is better seafood out there in Charlotte.
