We had some friends out shopping and told them about this good Chinese place. It was big but mostly empty...  which isn't a good sign to me at 12:00 noon on a weekday.  The ladies went ahead and I parked the car. The hostess told me that there were not three ladies sitting together. I know they just walked in ahead of me. I spotted them in the corner.First impression: the place is old and in need of some updates. It was really dark inside. There were far too many employees on staff for a restaurant with so few patrons.   They sat us at a booth in the corner.  Our table was served the traditional bowls of watered down hot mustard and pink duck sauce...  the fried noodles were too done almost burnt a disappointment.  We had four people at our table. I ordered Hot and spicy scallops fried rice and an egg roll.  Two people in our party ordered chicken broccoli with fried rice and egg rolls. One ordered chicken with cashews fried rice and an egg roll. The hot and sour soup was delicious and just the right temperature. When the food arrived the portion sizes seemed correct and the fried rice was tasty with egg peas and pork pieces in it.  I'm sad to say that the rice was the best part of our plates. One person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered. The waitress did offer to get the fried rice.  My scallops were undercooked and stringy and mushy I could tell they were almost done but just barely edible. It tasted very much like the brown sauce was burnt.  The egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt.  The aquarium was nice and we enjoyed it for a few minutes on the way out. I had eaten here before and it was much better in the past. So they Great Wall is not so great. Maybe just have some soup for lunch. Sad to say I won't take friends here again.
