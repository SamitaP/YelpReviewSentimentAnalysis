If a place downtown isn't busy at lunch time then either you're much more wise than the hundreds of thousands of professionals OR the place stinks.  Fu Lai is the later.  The food was gross and I usually wouldn't say that about a place.  My General Tso's seemed to have been previously frozen and I think I got 100% gristle.  I don't shriek at the sight of MSG but this place uses a bit much.  I got a whopping 2 pieces of wilted broccoli and 1 sliver of onion in my dish and the sauce ewww the sauce.  Not sure why I stepped into Fu Lai probably because I wanted some cheap Chinese.  Never going back.
