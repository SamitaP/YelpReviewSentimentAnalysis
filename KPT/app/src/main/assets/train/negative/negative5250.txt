I've been coming here for the past 10 years and have always enjoyed the food and  the atmosphere so I'm sad to have to write a review that speaks poorly about the place.  Having said that my last experience at Tessaro's was ruined before we were even seated.  While waiting with my girlfriend to be seated for 25 minutes a party of 3 walks in and is immediately seated.  When I ask why a party of 3 would be seated before the many parties of 2 waiting I was told that the seating was laid out specifically to accommodate a specific number of people: absurd!  We proceed to wait another 15 minutes until a 2 top opened up.  I would gladly recommend this place on the food but given how inefficient the seating system is I'd only go when you can be seated right away.
