My boyfriend and I went here for a nice birthday dinner. I thought it would have mire Japanese options on the menu being named soba. I ordered the black truffle-potato samosa which was not bad. I also had the chopped salad which I suprisingly really enjoyed despite it being iceburgh lettuce which is definitely not what I use for a good salad. I wish they didn't put fried batter all over it though. Last I had the vegetarian curry dish the only vegetarian main I found. It was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice! No delicious fragrant jasmine rice....Also deep fried the Naan didn't enjoy that. The potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall. We were put at a table in the very corner of the third floor and all I had to stare at was a wall and an ugly floating tv hutch. It was very cold.We were the first people in the restaurant but took FOREVER to get served. Everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I heard umi is also one of their restaurants and I loved it so I thought this one may have been just as good. It was not enjoyable. Also the valet took FOREVER though it's a tiny parking lot right outside the front door and the booth was freezing despite a heater hanging way too high and no door. Heat rises....I thought most people knew this.
