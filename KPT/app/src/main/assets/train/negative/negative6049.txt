Rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren't sure if children or non-locals were not appreciated.  We walked into a virtually empty restaurant at 6 on a Monday; got the once over; and the hostess said i hope you have a reservation.  We have a big crowd at 6:30. You can wait for 45 minutes at the wine bar. We walked outside and easily booked a reservation on Open Table for 6:15 so we walked back in and were seated right away.  Food was ok--puttanesca tasted like yellow mustard but caprese was awesome.  We repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though.  I should mention that when we arrived a family with small children were leaving after finishing their meal and they had a stock-pile of high chairs in plain view so it was not unreasonable to bring our well-behaved girls (6 and 2 yrs old).  By 6:30 there were still a number of empty tables.If you're not from Pittsburgh there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children I would avoid this place.
