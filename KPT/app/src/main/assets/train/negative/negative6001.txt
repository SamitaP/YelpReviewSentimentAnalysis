Way overpriced for just ok food.  On a Tuesday night there was a long wait.  The staff wasn't overly friendly and when we had to wait they simply pointed towards the wine bar.  Having never been there before I was confused by having to pass through the outside to get to the bar.  While I thought the wine bar was cozy the other customers there were rude and self-centered ignoring polite excuse me by the waitstaff.   When we were finally seated we waited about 10 minutes before a server appeared.  The food was prompt and the salad was more than enough to share.  The pizza was simply ok.  I've had much better wood-fired pizza elsewhere.Beware:  for just a party of five they added a 20% tip onto the bill.  If you're going to add a tip to a bill make it the customary 18%.  But frankly I didn't think they needed to add the tip for us.  Also do not use multiple credit cards.  I was charged for the entire bill on my card even though we asked to split it between two.  I'm still waiting for my overpayment to be refunded by the restaurant...
