I came here craving some sushi.  Looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant.  I was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and I love supporting small mom and pops.  I figured this may be a little diamond in the rough.  Man was I wrong.  The sushi was not fresh.  The sushi wasn't rolled tight either.  The rice didn't have the trademark sushi rice flavor. Spoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of California I felt like the ingredients were sort of old.  Considering I went in on a Saturday I figured it might be better but it wasn't at all.The service was good.  That's the justification for the 2 stars.  Otherwise I really wouldn't recommend this place to other people.
