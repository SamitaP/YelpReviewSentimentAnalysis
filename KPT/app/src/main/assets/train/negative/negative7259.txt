This place can pass as average if you order the right thing.  I have taken out from here about a dozen times in the past year mainly because it is so convenient to my place but after trying their sweet and sour chicken this last time I will probably stay away for now (soggy/slimy not very appetizing or tasty).  Entrees like chicken with any kind of veggies/mushrooms are okay.  Price is not bad.  Why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh?
