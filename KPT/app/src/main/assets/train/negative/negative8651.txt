My boyfriend and I went here hoping for better-than-average bar food and a good home brew while in Charlotte but it was just meh. We were told we would wait for 20 minutes which seemed ridiculous as there were open tables all over the restaurant and bar and finally got seated in one of these open tables after 40 minutes of waiting. The $10 calamari was a very small portion the sauces were obviously not made in-house and the pieces of calamari were TINY! We both ordered mediocre salads and didn't find their brews to be anything special. Would have rather spent $50 elsewhere.
