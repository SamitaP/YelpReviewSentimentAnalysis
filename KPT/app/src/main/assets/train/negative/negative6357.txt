We have been regulars at Soba for years sharing a few appetizers at the bar-lounge on a quiet evening and enjoying the food. Last night was different. For the very first time the food was awful.  A scallion pancake replaced the kimchee pancake. The chef who we learned was new obviously had no idea that a pancake is the glue that holds a tasty morsel together. This was pure glue tasteless and sticky. Where was the content the taste the flavor? The lump-crab egg roll was worthy of a corner take-out Chinese eatery oily mostly. A pulled pork appetizer was passable nowhere near the dish it replaced. find a new chef quickly.John E. Raffie.
