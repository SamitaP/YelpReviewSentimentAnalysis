We took our daughter there for her birthday a while ago per her request.  We had a good group with us but unfortunately they sat us upstairs right next to the band which made it very difficult for conversation among all of us.  We've eaten our way through New Orleans a couple of times but this to me was not quite up to par.  Especially at $15-$20 a plate.  I've been here twice and unfortunately I don't think I'll be back.  Fun atmosphere great service and yes it would be a good date night.  But not a good group night.
