This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel. I got a personal pizza and my friend got an Italian hoagie. One slice of this pizza and I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen to me. I finished the slice and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought her hoagie was okay but the pizza...oh the horror of the pizza. Avoid.
