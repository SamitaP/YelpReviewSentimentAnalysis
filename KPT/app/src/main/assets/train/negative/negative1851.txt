Well finally tried the place with the Green door and High Step!  Always seem to be people going in and out.  Heard from one of my kids it was just OK cause he had take out once with some buddies.  Well we ventured in and ordered a few things so we could share.  General Ts0's chicken was  to be crisp and Ouch spicy...Well the outer crust was crisp chicken was hard..hard to chew tasteless and somewhat sweet sauce???  The Shrimp Lo Mein was Ok but the shrimp was overcooked.  The Moo Shu Pork was forgettable.
