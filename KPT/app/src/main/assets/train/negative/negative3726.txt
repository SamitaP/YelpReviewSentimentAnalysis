No nope uh uh no way please don't call this an Italian restaurant. Overcooked mushy noodles watery tomato gravy and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced. Can't give this place anything lower than 1 star. Seriously Olive Garden is a joke and I rate it higher than this place. Again my advice to any Italian food lover find a good neighborhood family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate.
