Prepare to be wowed. High class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. Gar√ßon I asked may I try some of your french fried potatoes? I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence.
