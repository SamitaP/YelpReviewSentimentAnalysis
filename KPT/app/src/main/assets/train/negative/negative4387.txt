I think that typically sports bars are really not expected to have good food.  They just need to have four things1. ESPN2. Nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff3. beer specials4. big screen TVs.Well Sports Rock failed on all accounts.  I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar he had the Georgia game on within minutes. The nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese they weren' that bad.   Plus beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.If you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.  Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception.
