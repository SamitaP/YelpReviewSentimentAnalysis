Went to Getaway last night for famous fajitas. Not so famous anymore... Waitress brought steaming hot plate after very long wait she forgot the taco shells when she finally got back  she brought pita bread instead I corrected her she appologized and fixed it. The cooked meat was bland  no seasoning like they used to have.wifes steak was overbooked and dry.were looking for a new place now.
