I'm not a huge pizza fan so my review may be a little biased based on my taste. But I do enjoy an occasional pizza pie & Fuel just isn't impress me all that much.I've eaten at this Fuel in downtown Charlotte for late night several times & the place is always packed. They're open after the bars close so expect some long lines full of boozed up late nighters. And unlike some other late night options in Charlotte Fuel takes quite a while to get your order placed & then you have to wait again to actually get your food. This whole line/wait can take from 20 min up.Once you get to the front of line they have a lot of pizza topping options from your basics to some odd ones. Along with pizza slice choices they also have garlic knots which actually may be better than the pizza. When you finally do get your food the pizza is nothing special especially considering your wait. To me it's just your average run of the mill pizza.I'd much rather have a different late night meal than pizza but I still don't think their pizza is worth the wait. But if you really do crave pizza after bar hopping then head to Fuel Pizza for a lengthy wait to satisfy your pizza hunger.
