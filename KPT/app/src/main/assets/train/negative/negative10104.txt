My co-workers and I stopped by here because downtown Charlotte looks like a ghost town at night and didn't find anything too compelling from fellow yelper's so we went stopped here since we were all familiar with it. Hate writing about larger franchise restaurants but wanted to let people know about our horrible experience. The wait staff seemed like we were a nuisance for patronizing their pizza shop and the attitude resonated for the duration of our meal. We sat outside where homeless people bummed for money and we saw a fight with plenty of profanity (felt bad for guests w/ kids) between a local and one of the bums who tried earlier to act like we bumped into him knocking his food on the sidewalk (expecting you would feel sorry for him and fork over some $$). When we ordered our waitress said I wouldn't get the soup right now when one of us tried to order some which made us all question the safety/age of other menu items. The food took forever to get and the waitress kept asking if we wanted more beer every time she came by. The beer she recommended Red Oak a local beer didn't please any of our pallets which made the wait even longer. 4 of 5 orders came out with something wrong so (big surprise) so we just sucked it up and got out of there ASAP. I apologize for the long review but this place was so bad I had to share my experienceDefinitely won't be back
