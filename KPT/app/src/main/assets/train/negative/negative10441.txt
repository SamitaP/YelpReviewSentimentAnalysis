I want to preface this by letting you know  that I am not picky about my sushi. But unfortunately I had the worst sushi I've ever had at Fujo. We split a salmon roll a spicy tuna roll and a Godzilla roll. The salmon was too tough to be chewed. The spicy tuna roll had tempura flakes on the outside that tasted horribly stale and like they'd been cooked in extremely rancid oil. The Godzilla roll was yummy but not amazing - it was the most redeeming part of the meal for sure though. We also tried the sesame tofu and it was a huge disappointment - the tofu was so hard it was difficult to chew and it came with almost no veggies (4 tiny broccoli florets don't count). Our server was friendly and attentive and that's what's keeping this review from being a lower one. I didn't send anything back or complain to the server because it was a week night we were tired and we knew we wouldn't be back again. All in all it was def not my best groupon date night. Live and learn!
