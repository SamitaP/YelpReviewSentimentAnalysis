We stopped here to share three appetizers after sharing three appetizers at BlackFinn.  What a mistake!  The lobster crab cakes were one bite if that and its questionable if there was actually lobster and crab in there.  We also had two Scallops wrapped in prosciutto saut√©ed crisp and served over a fava bean puree topped withlemon marmalade which were just mediocre and 3 Risotto balls which were stuffed with pancetta sweet onions and mozzarella fried crispy and servedwith a rich tomato sauce.   What a disappointment the risotto balls were very bland and gummy.  The only good thing was the Lemon Drop Martini.  We should have eaten more at BlackFinn we will know for our next trip.
