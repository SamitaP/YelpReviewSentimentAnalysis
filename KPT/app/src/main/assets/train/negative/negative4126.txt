Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive along with the cracked out waiter (who we hadn't seen for at least 30 minutes) The steak was total bullshit. Overcooked and cold. The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area. Where do these people come from? and is there nothing better to do except sit around market square smoke cigarettes and throw your trash everywhere so city workers can clean up after your filthy asses? My advice to you son is do the same as your father and his father did...get a job!!!
