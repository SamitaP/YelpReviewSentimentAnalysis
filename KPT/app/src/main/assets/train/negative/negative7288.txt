Food blah.  Pierogi with chipotle butter app was terrible- frozen Mrs. T's pierogi in PITTSBURGH is just lazy and they were drowning in greasy room temp aforementioned butter which carried heat with absolutely no flavor.  Everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality. Main courses were a cuban sandwich and something I don't recall (bad sign) and were extremely disappointing.Service argh.  It was late but if you're open you're open right?  Slow inattentive wrong sides (which we couldn't correct given the service) an they basically vacuumed around our feet.
