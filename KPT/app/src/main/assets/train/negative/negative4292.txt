soooo disappointing!  i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes.  also having lived for some time in NYC i am familiar with and a fan of Bastianich restaurants.  one of the best meals i've ever had in my life (there aren't many) was at Del Posto.  the Bastianich name to me stands for integrity and love / appreciation / sharing of high quality italian food.  then i ate here.  are these the same people running this restaurant?!  it was completely mediocre and subpar as if no one cared about the quality or experience.i came here for brunch and did the pasta trio and antipasti table.  it was clear the ingredients were not quality and the dishes were mass produced without much flavor or thought.  it was only $25 a person but can you make an effort?  don't you care about your reputation and good name?  guess not.this restaurant seems to be a sellout - a place to make money off the name in a place where the food standard frankly isn't that demanding or high (like in NYC).  also the service was not that good.  too bad.
