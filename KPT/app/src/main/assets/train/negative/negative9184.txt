Let me start off by saying that my experience was horrible and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  My wife and I came to Charlotte celebrating our anniversary and decided to try Mert's per recommendation of her supervisor and because of the high praise the restaurant received online.  We were seated in a reasonable time but it was all down hill from there. We were seated at 7:15pm and were given some bland cornbread.  At 8:15pm we were still waiting for our order to be prepared (cooked)...not brought to us...PREPARED! Now mind you no one even a word of apology or an update on the status of our food during the wait. Finally I had enough and walked out. Our waitress and management still did not offer an apology despite seeing us leave the restaurant visibly upset. We left and walked to E2 (emeralds restaurant) and received the best meal and customer service I've ever experienced. I'd recommend all the other restaurants in downtown Charlotte before Mert's. :-/
