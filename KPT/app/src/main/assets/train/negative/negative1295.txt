I was a bit disappointed with the pizza I got. I ordered the Milano special pizza which had pepperoni bacon sausage bell peppers mushrooms olives tomatoes etc and the popcorn chicken. The order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great. Although the pizza tasted decent the crust was not crispy at all the slices were pretty floppy. They also skimped on the toppings a bit. I was hoping for a more loaded pizza. I'm not watching my weight--I can handle it. As far as the popcorn chicken goes it was too salty even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably not ordering from here again.
