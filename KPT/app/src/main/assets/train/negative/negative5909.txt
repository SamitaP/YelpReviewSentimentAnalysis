As I stated before  I don't review chain restaurants unless something is outstanding or horrible . Well  this place is beyond horrible . If I could give negative  stars I would . The food was typical McDonalds . Not good or bad . The service  however  was terrible . As I placed my order  the greeting I got was  what do you want  . The woman who waited on my obviously didn't finish the sixth grade and didn't care about manners . She was slow as molasses even though there were several people in line behind me . After taking time out to BS to a coworker about her weekend  she gave me my order and never said  thankyou . I replied  your welcome  very loudly to make a point but got a mean stare in return . I asked to speak to manager but was told he was busy for next 15 minutes or so . I left and as I was driving away  I saw the manager and two other workers grabbing a smoke near the rear door . No wonder the service was horrible !!! Will never stop here again .
