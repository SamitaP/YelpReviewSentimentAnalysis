We went to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the food was great; quality was adequate. Service was abysmal. Just as an example our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention was stretched into painful wait times. Never received a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.As far as the food went it was good - I had the Admiral's Feast which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much but if I get in the mood for those again I may just phone in an order and pick it up.I just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.As far me I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward.
