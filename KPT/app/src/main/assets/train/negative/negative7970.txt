I'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the French onion pot roast. I can safely say that I will never order either again. The soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt. The pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever. It was tender but the mushrooms and carmelized onions were not in evidence. To make matters worse the corn was flavorless and the mashed potatoes had no butter. Tiffany failed as our server tonight but Tracey stepped up and refreshed our drinks and brought me melted butter and grilled onions.
