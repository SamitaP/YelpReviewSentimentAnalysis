AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!Our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.I ordered what the waiter claimed was their signature dish Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had re-heated it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he saw the chef reheat the food.  By this time my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 1/3.We told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.The following week I contacted Blerim Meta the General Manager of this restaurant as well as Aquavina.  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.AVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!
