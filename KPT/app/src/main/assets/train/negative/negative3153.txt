I understand Primanti is a historic institution here in Pittsburgh but other than the name I don't think it has much going on unless you're in the mood for quantity versus quality. I got reeled into my experience because everyone said to try it when I moved here. Really simple menu as you just choose the meat you'd like in your sandwich. I went with pastrami which was good but the combination of the cole slaw tomato french fries and bread was just okay and made it soggy as I finished the second half. The sheer size of it all was just too much too. I wouldn't return again though if you're visiting and into doing Pittsburgh touristy stuff I would say you would need to experience Primanti to judge for yourself.
