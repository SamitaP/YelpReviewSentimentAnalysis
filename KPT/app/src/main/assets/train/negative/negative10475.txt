While I hate nailing a place that has so few reviews I'm afraid I have to give this place one star.  Some of you might say well what did you expect from a strip mall Chinese joint?  Well some of the best Chinese food on the West Coast is in a strip mall or even in a bad part of town.  Sadly this restaurant is not only shabby inside and out but their food is just as shabby.Their sauces taste bottled with a one-size fits all sort of technique:  pile on thick gunky brown sauce on everything and call it Chinese.  Plates that are old and worn.  Dirty glasses.  Shelves that appeared thick with dust.  A faded Best of Charlotte frame on the wall that dates back to many years ago. It's sad to see a small business that just doesn't get it.  The food here falls short of the worst  Chinese food in a mall food court. That says it all.
