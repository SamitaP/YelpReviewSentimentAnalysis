No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices like the cheapest entree was $40 try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there.
