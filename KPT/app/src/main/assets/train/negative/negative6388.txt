I used to go to Chaya in Squirrel Hill at least once a week but since I've moved this past summer it's been difficult to enjoy sushi as frequently.  Thus I decided to test out Umi based on the good reviews I found on the web.  Sadly I was grossly disappointed.  The interior decor is pretentious (large water fountain in the middle of the dining room and Japanese style paintings and decorations throughout) and dark (who likes eating in a place where you can barely see your food?).  The sushi was okay at best but the quality of the fish certainly does not even come close to Chaya's.  The dishes were overpriced for the quality of the food basically you'd be paying for the fake ambiance.  I guess the waiter was nice in that he tried to explain our dishes but frankly he does not know too much.  This is one of those Americanized versions of an Asian restaurant and not authentic (key indicator: most of the patrons were not Asian).  It was nothing that would make me want to come back.
