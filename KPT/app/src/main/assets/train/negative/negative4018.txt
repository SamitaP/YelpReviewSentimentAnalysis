Horrible service and the food is not comparable to any other Ruth Chris I have been to and I've been to them in 10-15 different cities. My rib-eye was all fat and the waitress was so snotty we wanted to throw our drinks at her. Save your money this place doesn't deserve to be named Ruth Chris. I've had better steaks at the Outback Steakhouse!!
