I walked in sat down and ordered an IC light. Looked around and realized that this restaurant looks awfully like one of the restaurants I saw on the food network where the guy goes around and eats these ridiculously large meals. After eating a Pittsburgher (the second most popular dish) and trying the colossal fish sandwich and a capicola sandwich I've decided that the best part of my meal was the IC light. My friend's colossal fish was the best of the three and it's best eaten as two meals. My Pittsburgher was the pitts and I wouldn't order it again. Unlike your pitts on a 90+ degree day it was really dry. The sandwich was only salvaged by my grotesque use of hot sauce. The concept isn't that ridiculous either. Just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich. The chili cheese fries were mediocre as well but the portion again was hugemongous.I'd come back here if I were in Pittsburgh again because its just a nice place to chill at on Market Square. But the food is only serviceable. Substituting quantity with quality can only get you so far.The ambiance service atmosphere and tradition makes this place pretty unique but it don't make the food taste better.
