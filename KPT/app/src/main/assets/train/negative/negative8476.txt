Went for lunch with a group of girls from work. Waitress was completely overwhelmed. She had too many tables and I didn't see a manager out helping her once. We ordered our food at 12:15 and asked where our food was 12:45. Didn't get our food until after 1. I had a meeting and told the waitress to nix my order. She came out with orders and dropped the tray as she was handing out food. 2 people didn't get their food and the other 4 had to get to go boxes. Food isn't good either. Changes need to be made. I have never had a good experience here.
