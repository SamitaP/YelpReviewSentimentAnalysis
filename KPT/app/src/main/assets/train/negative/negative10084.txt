Not impressed.  Went for lunch with a group.  No one really bragged about their meal especially me.  I told the waiter what I was debating between and he suggested the brisket saying it is good and very filling.  I ordered the brisket.  It came out about 5 minutes after the rest of my table was served and the piece I was served was well over half pure fat.  Due to the fact that half was inedible to me I was hungry again within 3 hours.  If I am ever in Charlotte again I will find another place to eat.
