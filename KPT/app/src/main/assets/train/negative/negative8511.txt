Went here for a corporate dinner. Had the finger sandwiches (chicken pulled pork and something else) chips and spinach dip lobster cakes and potato cakes. Only tried the pulled pork which was good but others said the chicken sandwich disappointed. Lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo.Spinach dip the only saving grace. Oh and their lemon bar dessert.
