This abomination certainly left much to be desired. There was a considearble wait from the ordering of drinks to receiving them again to order food and even longer to get our food. When it finally came they had mixed up who ordered what wrong sides with the entree etc. All of our orders from the 3 steaks to the sampler platter to the mini chili dogs were lukewarm at best. One of the steaks even managed to taste like they had dropped it into the bottom of the grill. Think smokey like campfire-smelling clothes smokey but flavored that way.The manager comped a portion of our meals but the apparent lack of cusomer service and quality control more than overshadowed his attempt to make things right. I refuse to EVER set foot in this sub-par establishment again.
