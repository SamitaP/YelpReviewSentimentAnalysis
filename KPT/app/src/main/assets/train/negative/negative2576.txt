Very disappointing. We love Japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in Pittsburgh. Nice atmosphere service was fine but our dinner was average to poor. The salad dressing was tasteless the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy.  It tasted more steamed than hot grilled. The shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful.Our chef ( new and slow) compulsively wiped his knives and the grill (which was dirty when we sat down) with a dirty rag? I guess a lot depends on the chef you get but ours cooked a tasteless meal. The sushi people ordered at the table looked good. We are not big on the circus atmosphere of Saga but the Wexford location does have the best hibachi food in Pittsburgh to our taste.
