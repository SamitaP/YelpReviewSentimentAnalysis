We made a reservation and were told that seating was on time we waited 15 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. The food was awful my pregnant fiancé ordered a filet medium rare that came out medium well!  Who cooks a filet medium well?  My father-in-laws strip was so over seasoned he could barely eat it.  But since we waited over an hour for our food he had to eat it.  Our reservation was for 8:15 and we did not eat until after 10:00.  We all ordered medium rare steaks and one lobster tail.  It should not take over an hour to prepare.  The filet was taken off the bill however that does not help the fact that a pregnant women had to wait so long to eat and when it came out she didn't even eat.  I shared mine with her as did her dad share his but as mentioned above his steak was awful too.  My Cajun ribeye was good and so was my mother-in-laws lobster.  We ordered chocolate soufflé for dessert and it didn't even have chocolate on it.  It tasted like scrambled eggs with whipped cream.  I have to tell you that was by far one of the worst dining experiences we have had.  The four of us eat out together once a week and tend to go to more pricey restaurants.  This was terrible and I am sure we do not plan on returning.
