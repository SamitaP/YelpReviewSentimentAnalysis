I really want to like this place because it is right across the street from where I work and we really have no other lunch options that are very close by.  However it is very incosistent.  The past 3 times I have gone for lunch they have been out of something for the chicken cesear salad but have not told me until I receive my order.  The first time they were out of parmesean cheese the second time they were out of the usual sliced white meat chicken and replaced it with what appeared to be shredded leg meat and finally today they only had half a small to go cup of dressing.  All three of these items seem to be very important to making a salad that only has 4 ingredients.  If I would have known this upfront I would not order the cesear salad.  I guess I should always ask before I order to ensure that they have all of the ingredients.  In addition it seems a little pricey for what they offer.  I can pay $9 and get a better salad at many other places uptown I guess they are able to charge for convienence.
