I love Irish Pubs and pub food but the food at Ri Ra was bland and without taste. I ordered the Goat Cheese Fritters as a starter and the Corned Beef and Cabbage as my main dish. The fritters were nothing more than goat cheese balls rolled in some sort of dry breadcrumb-like coating and then deep-fried and topped with caramelized sweet onions. There was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste. Corned Beef and Cabbage is an Irish Pub staple but Ri Ra has absolutely no clue how to prepare it. The corned beef was bland and somewhat tough and despite the fact that they put some sort of cream sauce on it it still had no flavor. The cabbage was both undercooked and without any hint of seasoning. Even adding salt and pepper did not help it. I did not eat the mashed potatoes that came with the dish so I can't comment on them. Ri Ra is a fairly nice looking place with a decent selection of beers on tap and if you just go there for drinks you should be fine. However there are many places where you will get a much better meal and I would definitely avoid the food at Ri Ra.
