I've been here a few times and it was pretty decent. The food is alright a little oversauced at times which I'm not a big fan of. The only problem I have with it is that they give you a huge bowl of curry with a small scoop of rice and when you ask for more rice they charge you 1.50 a bowl! Either give larger portions of rice with a dinner-sized curry entree or cut down on the portions it's RIDICULOUS that I have to spend up to an extra 3 bucks just to have enough rice for my entree.
