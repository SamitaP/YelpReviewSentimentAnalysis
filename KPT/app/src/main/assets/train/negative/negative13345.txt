Went to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM.  A few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all.  Like other reviewers I liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool.  I sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu.I ordered a Green Tea Sake...SOOO GOOD!  It came in a little glass bottle and it called Sake2Me.  I plan to buy it!As I enjoyed my sake I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings.  Totally not what I expected...two roll-like dough things came out and it tasted like it looked...just like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettuce-like pieces and tiny chopped meat.  I didn't see any shrimp not even mini shrimp.  I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough the waiter said You don't like your shrimp dumpling? I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except I want to have room for my Pad Thai.  So I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.The Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great but not bad.  Once in a while I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.I'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.  If I'm starved and can't find any other place I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says dumpling.
