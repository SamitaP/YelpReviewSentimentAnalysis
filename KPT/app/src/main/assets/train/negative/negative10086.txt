I went to Cosmos once for lunch and the Cajun chicken panini wasn't bad. I went back again for half off appetizers and was horribly disappointed. We got the crab dip which has no discernible pieces of crab meat and tasted as if the whole dip (including meat) had been pureed. We also got the stuffed mushrooms which arrived shriveled and left too much to be desired.
