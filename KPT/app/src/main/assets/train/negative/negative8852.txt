My first meal as a Charlottean was had at this establishment.  I had a taste for fish and so was pleased to find more than a few appealing options on the dinner menu.  I opted for the trout preceded by the classic french onion soup.  David X. had the special a smoked salmon pasta.The good: the trout was delightful well complimented by potatoes and a light tomatoey sauce.  The portions were perfect aka not too big.  Basically this dish saved the experience for me.The ok: the bread was warm (not hot) and the salmon special was pretty good too.  Smoked salmon plus creamy sauce yum.The underwhelming: the french onion soup was not hot.  The cheese was not bubbling or gooey it was a bit congealed.  Meh.  And to echo the words of others the service was more than just pokey.  This was a bit absurd because we were the only people eating in the restaurant.Would I come back? Maybe to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much. Maybe they're a bit more on top of their game for breakfast/brunch.  But probably not for dinner.
