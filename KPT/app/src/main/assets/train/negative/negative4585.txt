Had dinner at Lemon Grass earlier this week. When I walked in the place was empty. Got to pick where I wanted to sit. First thing I noticed is the place was an absolute sauna. I asked my server about why it was so hot in the restaurant? She shrugged and did not seem interested.I ordered the Lemon Grass soup with shrimp and the Papaya salad. I used the terms Tom Yum and Som Tum when I ordered. These terms are not used in their menu - I was under the impression they were fairly standard terms for these Thai menu items. In any case - she had no clue to what I was referring to - so I used their terms.Soup came out immediately - soup was not very spicy or lemon grassy - which is ironic given the name of this place. There was a lot more tomato chunks in their version of this soup than I've experienced before. I would not order this again.Then the Papaya salad came out - just ok - not spicy and bright like a good Papaya salad should be.Water glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty.Won't come back here again unless they do something about the lack of AC and better food!
