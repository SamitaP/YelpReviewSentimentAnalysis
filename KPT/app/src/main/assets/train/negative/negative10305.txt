I loved this place the first time but I went back for Restaurant Week and was incredibly disappointed.Fisherman's Daughter Wild Shrimp and Cucumber Salad - NOTE: This is NOT a salad. It's 4 cocktail shrimp with sweetened tomato sauce and a shreds of cucumbers. Bleh.Prosciutto Flat Bread - Had a really stinky fontina cheese and I felt the sage was too pungent. Also I didn't like the quality of the flatbread.Alaskan Halibut with a Lobster Succotash - Most flavorless halibut I have ever had. Lobster cream sauce should never be flavorless! I added a boatload of salt so it was somewhat bearable. The Cake di Chocolate is standard lava cake (takes forever to make).The Pecan Pie was HUGE. The Sticky Toffee Pudding was very butterscotchy. Overall? Not a fan.Maybe if I come back next time I'll have better luck?
