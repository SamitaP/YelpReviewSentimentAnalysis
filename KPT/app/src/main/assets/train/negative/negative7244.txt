We used to visit this place most every time we went to Pittsburgh.   The menu has change and so has the food  I ordered off the lunch lunch special and the Kung Pao Chicken was average at best and the egg roll was horrible.  My friends has water chestnuts with black spots in their dishes.  We shall not be going back there.
