We were excited to try the Original Oyster House given its history and nice outdoor seating in market square. We were prepared for foam plates and cash only which works for a nice lunch outside. Sadly we were disappointed with our meal. Our group of 3 tried the breaded oysters famous fried fish beer-battered fish nuggets and crab cakes with fries and onion rings. Although the portions were generous for being fried much of the food was soggy due to the excess of grease. We were in an area with a server but the service was terrible. Our server continually ignored us and frequently forgot items she was supposed to bring to the point that we went inside to get the items ourselves. The food is a good deal if you are willing to overlook the service and like really greasy fried seafood.
