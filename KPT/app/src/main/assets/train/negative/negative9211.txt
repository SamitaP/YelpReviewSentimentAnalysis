Walking Uptown on a Sunday morning before church my wife daughter and I stopped into Mert's.  Our waitress gave us the specials but said them so fast and with such apparent disinterest that neither my wife nor I understood any of what she said.  We ended up ordering one of the specials after seeing them on a chalkboard only to find out after some more confusing disinterested interaction with our waitress that they had stopped the special just minutes before (9:30am).  Don't know what that meant; did they run out of spinach?  Strange. We ended up with two other omelettes the garden and the shrimp creole.  We had to ask three different waitresses for our accompanying toast and biscuit and once we had our food our waitress interrupted our prayer to ask if we needed ketchup (understandable but most servers notice bowed heads even if it's kinda awkward).  We did need the ketchup but it didn't come until the end of our meal and my wife's home fries were already cold.  My regular cup of coffee was mediocre my shrimp creole omelette had 2 small shrimp inside (super disappointing as they were tasty) making my $8 omelette mostly egg and tomato sauce and my wife's toast was hard as a rock.Obviously a rough experience for us this morning but Mert's gets the second star because my wife loved her omelette (the garden) my biscuit and grits were pretty good and they let us choose our seating (with a young child this can be pretty important). We won't be back.
