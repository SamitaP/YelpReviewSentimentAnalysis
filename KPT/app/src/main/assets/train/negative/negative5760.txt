First I must clarify that my rating here is based on my scale of pizza-ratings only. This pizza is certainly edible but it is not at the top of my pizza-scale a place reserved for the Grimaldis and Lombardis of the world (or more realistically just the U.S.; Italian pizza I have heard and trust is even better).Fiori's is just underwhelming. I had family from New Jersey visiting and we were looking to grab a few pies after exploring around town. Piccolo Forno was unfortunately closed so I looked to the trusty internet to help me find something near our location that had a good reputation. Fiori's was a popular choice with decent ratings so we headed over that way. The restaurant space is cramped and only conducive to tables of 4 guests or less in a party. Service was helpful friendly and quick. But the pizza just fell flat. The sauce was so sweet which is not normal outside of this region (not sure what sweet tomato sauce is about but I don't dig it. There has to be sugar added or something.). Dough was ok but wasn't that perfect medium for the simple yet magical tomato and mozzarella combination that it ought to be. If you are expecting New York style pizza this is NOT the place for you. Average at best but better than your fast-food pizza places if you are in a pinch. For me that will be never.
