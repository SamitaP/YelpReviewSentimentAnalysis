This restaurant has never been great but if you wanted an Asian restaurant in the Cultural District it was an OK place to go. However last night's dinner was just plain bad. I had beef salad and it was some coolish beef on iceberg lettuce with sliced onions and a totally forgetful sauce. Nothing like the mix of sweet sour and spice that it should have. I also had tofu panang. It was also virtually tasteless. Some coconut milk flavoring in otherwise nondescript brown sauce with no spiciness.
