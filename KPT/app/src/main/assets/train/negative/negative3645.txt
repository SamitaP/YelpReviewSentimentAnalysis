Dirty unclean my friend and I went to lunch here.  She went to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to the table had the following story to tell.  To get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs. When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood.  Christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that.  The food was tasty but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyone's kitchen.
