Had an awful crab cake here with little crab in it but mostly lots of breading and filler.. Even the Phillips brand ones at Costco are better than most. And of course Eleven has the best ever. But anyways hubby got a deep fried cod filet that was sandwiched between 2 hamburger buns which was pretty decent fried fish while it was hot and crispy... But my crab cake was sadly unforgivable.
