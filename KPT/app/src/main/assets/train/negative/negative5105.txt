Worst food in Pittsburgh. That's all. I have been there twice never my choice I had tummy ache both times. I think the food is boring. Don't get me wrong I have no problem with non-gourmet food but Ritter's is just blah. It also was an unclean feel at times when you are seated and you look around. They are cash only also. That doesn't both me at Pamelas because the food is oh so delish. Here you are just wasting you apetite on food that has TONS of rooms for improvement.
