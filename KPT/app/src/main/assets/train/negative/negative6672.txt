As we strolled up Walnut Street this morning we were greeted by a large sandwich board sign advertising brunch.  Spirits lifted we raced inside for the sidewalk advertised  breakfast glories...sat down...and were told brunch was only on Sundays. My lil heart fell. Regroup. I ordered the half sandwich and chili and my partner in this mess ordered a chop salad.  The chili should be renamed Alpo & Cheddar. The salads are better at Get Go.And direct quote upon our server checking on us..drumroll....From what I see I presume you are okay and a quick exit stage left.We shall not be returning. Even as tempting as the $10 sangria made of pure canned fruit juice appears.
