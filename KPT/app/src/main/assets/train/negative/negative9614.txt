Not impressed!!  If there were 0 stars that's the rating this place would get.  I ordered a cheeseburger and it was worse than what you'd expect from a school lunchroom!   And why is this place called an Irish Pub?  One would expect typical Irish dishes but not here!  I honestly have no idea how this place stays in business.  Sorry Hartigan's I won't be going back!
