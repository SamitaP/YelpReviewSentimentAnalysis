Only a half step above a chain restaurant.My friend and I had been dying to get into the place but we really were excited and anxious about nothing... The meal started with the lobster mac&chz and stuffed hush puppies as appetizers. The good news were that the apps were presented well and very tasty.  The bad news is that they were the best part of the meal. The m&c had good texture and balance but was highly seasoned and both my dining partner and I felt that it was too salty. The hush puppies were spot on. Loaded with shrimp & crawfish in a delicate white sauce with toasted onion slivers. Yummy! The crispy texture of the hush puppies paired with the creamy sauce was just perfect.As for the entr√©es well that's a whole different story. I had the short ribs with the risotto. The ribs were cooked perfectly but the risotto was crunchy ( and I don't mean al dente) which made it difficult to enjoy the meal....I'm not interested in just eating a hunk of meat.  My companion had the Red Snapper which was served over jambalaya which was also lackluster. All in all it was just oh-Kay. For dessert I had the apple pie cheesecake. It clearly had not been made the same day because it had developed that skin on it that comes from keeping things refrigerated but uncovered. It was not edible.  This was $100 meal that was more like a 2 for $20 deal at Chili's or TGI Friday's. If I ever go back to this place again it will be for the apps only. Save your money.
