just got back from TaiPei. today was dinner AND a floor show. First the food was adequate except for the won ton for two which was full of won tons shrimp and chicken. with a light and not greasy broth.It was good.  The floor show erupted soon after we were seated when a young woman across the way began to harangue her mother...her mom apparently hadn't gone to enough of her soccor games as a child didnot know the names of her teammates had never taken a picture of her on the field and couldn't make up her mind about getting a f&^%ing iphone 5....i know all this because she wasn't shy about letting everyone in the restaurant hear her or letting the expletives fly. apparently no one has ever told her to knock it off including and especially from my perspective the manager of taiPei. He stood across the room with his mouth agape in shock but with no concern about the comfort of his other patrons and their dining experience. It was a bizarre and uncomfortable experience and follows a pattern of poor management decisions i have seen at tai pei recently.They know how to take in the money but are less than concerned with anything else.
