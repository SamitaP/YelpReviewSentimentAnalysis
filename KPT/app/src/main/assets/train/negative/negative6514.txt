Meh.  The Harris Grill is one more American business in a long line to have great ideas ruined by terrible execution.  An entire page of delicious looking burgers?  Bland and overcooked.  Cool looking spaces?  Can get cramped and awkward with groups and sometimes it's hard to get a server or bartender to notice you (I've never once thought a group outing here was anywhere approaching comfortable).  And what about the famed BACON NIGHT?  It's not even good bacon!They'll have to knock their game up several notches to achieve the potential contained in their great ideas.
