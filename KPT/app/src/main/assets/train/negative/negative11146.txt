I cannot believe this place exists! How is it competitive in Charlotte?The flavors are absurdly overdone: super salty super sweet and conflicting in that they pair savory with super sweet and drown it all out.I may have an answer: the place is filled with the elderly. Maybe it's The Walking Dead tongues. Seriously the youngest person there was in their early 50's. It's like a speak-easy for the rich elderly...it just keeps afloat by a secret handshake that acknowledges you are in a terrible place but you can be old there without the riff-raff.Also it is terribly expensive for the low quality they are putting on the plate. Even the drinks are super sweet.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
