I used to love Bruegger's bagels but mainly for their salt bagel. They make the perfect roast beef sandwich on this particular bagel and they may have just signed their own death warrant with me if they've discontinued making them. It tastes pretty damn close to a Beef on Weck. I went to this location the other day and they had a pretzel bagel in place of my beloved salt.  I did ask for the salt but they told me that they had the pretzel instead. I though what the heck I'll give it a try. Dammit...it comes nowhere close to the original! The line got too crowded for me to go up there and air my grievance because I did have another complaint that must be addressed: SOUP! Brueggers used to have a wealth of soups that they would rotate on a daily basis. Now they only have 2! Chicken spaetzle or black bean! Every single time I go to this location it's the same-old-same-old choices of soup! I realize it's Summer and maybe they don't move soup like they would during cooler weather but if you're offering it...mix it up!!!! If you go on their site they show they have about 8 different varieties but not this particular location. They used to have a delicious Velvet Veggie Cheese a few years ago but discontinued it. I even complained about that online and just got a thank you/try our other soups bull$hit courtesy response.No salt bagel is a deal breaker with me with Brueggers. The lack of soup varieties I can live with but killing one of my favorite sandwiches cannot be forgiven. I will return just to see for myself the next time if my precious salt bagel has been permanently replaced. If it has I will stage a walkout...but nobody else will follow.The WiFi sucks too.The only plus here is the friendly staff.Your sad palWalter
