This restaurant seemed perfect online but when I went there  it was totally different experience. As soon as stepped a foot in the restaurant I was in the face with bad smell which was combination of old frid fosh and burnt oil. This smell will stick to you for four to five  hours at least.The corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant. I ordered chicken wings which was cold and rubbery.My friend ordered po-boy chicken  tenders tge bread was old and hard consequendly  he couldn't eat his sandwich.
