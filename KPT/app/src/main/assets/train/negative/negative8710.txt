Bad service and mediocre food served cold.  If you have a large group and want to get together for lunch you would be better off bringing a bag lunch and meeting in a park.  We made reservations but it took 30 minutes for our order to be taken and the food didn't show until an hour later at which point we all had to get back to work. And the food was cold.The kicker is that this  wasn't the first time this has happened.  A few weeks ago we all got exactly the same horrible level of service with cold mediocre food.If I could give negative star rating I would.
