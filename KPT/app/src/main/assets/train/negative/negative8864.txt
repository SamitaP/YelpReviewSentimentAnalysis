This was my first time coming to this restaurant and I came because a lot people and media were talking about it. I took my Mom on Sunday for her birthday. The only thing good about our meal was the water orange juice and corn bread snack. Actually the OJ was room temperature so it was 'borderline good'.I ordered smoked pork chops home fries and green beans. My Mom order salmon cakes collard greens and mac-cheese. The pork chops had a good smoke flavor but they were too salty and paper thin. The fries were over-cooked and soft. The green beans were greasy and tasted sweet. Sometimes people will add a little sugar to green beans if they accidentally add too much salt; I believe that was the case.My Mom's salmon cakes were dry the collard greens were flavorless and under cooked (probably just stir-fried) and the mac-cheese was dry.Not only was the food bad but it wasn't even hot and my green beans had a little solid grease on them (eeewwwww!).I won't go back because the meal was expensive (w/tip) the parking was terrible and the food was no good.It was a total disappointment for me. I was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant.
