Driving down 7th I got reallllllly excited seeing a little mom-and-pops deli. The first thought that ran thru my head: Do they have prosciutto and cappicola? The answer: Prosciutto- yes; cappicola- no.So I ran in to get my cold cuts looking forward to a phenomenal lunch. The quality of the meat was very good. The service not so much.I stood at the counter nearly 25 minutes as he cut me 1/2 pound of turkey prosciutto american cheese mozzarella and bologna. 25 MINUTES! On top of it the guy wrapped the meat soooooo tight that it took me another 20 minutes to unwrap to make a sandwich.Also what kind of a market doesn't have bread you can buy? Literally the entire store NO BREAD! The only way I could have gotten bread was to order a sandwich and take it off. Will LBD be going back to this place you ask? Undecided. If I do he will definitely order his meats before he goes to ensure he doesn't have to wait any longer.This place needs improvement in the meats department. LBD scale- 3. PICK UP YOUR GAME!
