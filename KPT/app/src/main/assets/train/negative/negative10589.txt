Let me be clear: the 2nd star is based solely on the efforts of the staff to turn around our abysmal food experience. Based on food alone it would be a single star however the staff really tried to make it up to us.My husband and I ate here this evening. First off we were accosted by a quasi-speed metal song that was completely inappropriate to the setting. We were seated promptly without a reservation and the waiter quickly took our order.The server brought some cold salty garlic rolls. Not an encouraging start to the meal but we plowed ahead -- my husband ordered chicken parmesan and I ordered butternut squash ravioli. The chicken was breaded in what looked to be almost a cracker or corn flake crust rather than breadcrumbs making it heavy. The plate was just a big pile of spaghetti topped with this chicken wedge glued with red sauce. Not attractive adequately tasty.My ravioli was barely cooked. Some parts weren't cooked at all making an unappetizing paste-y glob. The server was quick to notice something amiss and  quickly replaced the plate with another entree the eggplant parmesan. Way too salty and an unholy mess of cheese and overcooked spaghetti.The side of spinach was also much too salty and I finally threw in the towel completely defeated by this awful meal. Maybe it was an off night but the people around us didn't seem to be having the same issues with their meals. If this is the best Italian food that Charlotte has to offer than I am forewarned. The manager came over and asked if there was anything he could do offered to comp us a dessert and generally tried to make things right. It was unfortunate that the meal was unsalveageable.
