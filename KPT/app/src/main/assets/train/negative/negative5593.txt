If you're famous why is there never anyone in your restaurant?  Seriously I live right around the corner and I've never seen more than one customer in there at a time and it's completely empty about 3/4 of the time I walk or drive by.  As one other reviewer rightly pointed out Sammy's seems to be famous for claiming to be famous.(Note: this is for a visit about ten months earlier - could've sworn I'd already written one.)  I'd been walking/driving past Sammy's for several months after moving into the neighborhood when I decided to finally hoof it over and try one of their famous corned beef sandwiches.  The sandwich itself was well mediocre at best.  There was a decent amount of meat but it was pretty average.  The other ingredients were also...average - certainly nothing that would generate fame because of its flavor.  Service was the usual gruff put-upon treatment I've come to expect from small businesses in da 'Burgh.  Prices were okay but no great bargain.  I haven't been back.Three stars for the sammich 1.5 for the rest.
