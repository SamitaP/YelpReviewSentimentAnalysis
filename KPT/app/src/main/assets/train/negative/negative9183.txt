WAIST OF TIME!!! My husband and I were in town for our 3 year anniversary and came to Merts after a great recommendation. We went to yelp and read the over all great reviews and were excited about trying this place. We waited about 20 min which was a good sign. The hostess wasn't too friendly but she was super busy so I could understand. Our waitress was an older lady who took our drink orders almost right away. Here is where it went down hill....she took her sweet time coming back to take our order( I know she saw me looking at her like WTH?) once our order was taken those were the very last words she spoke to us. We waited an HOUR with not so much as an I'm sorry this is taking too long or can I get you anything else? Finally my husband overheard a cook in the back yell that our order had not even been processed yet and was 4th in line!!! We threw a 5 on the table for that nasty too sweet diabetes lemonade they gave me and left! WILL NOT RETURN. OH....I'm not sure what corn bread everybody else on this reviews was eating but ours was WACK! Barley warm and not sweet at all. This place has EXTREMELY POOR customer service. We left and went to Emeralds restaurant where the service was SECOND TO NONE!
