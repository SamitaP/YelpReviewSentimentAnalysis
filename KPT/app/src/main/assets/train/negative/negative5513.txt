The only positive thing I can say is about this place it is open late.We ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed.Pancakes were burnt. Hash browns were burnt. A breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it. I was drunk I don't remember.Bah. Cook/waiter was funny so points for that.Again the only good thing was that it was open when I wanted food.
