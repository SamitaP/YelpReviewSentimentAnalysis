Uno Chicago Grill offers a terrific menu including their irresistible Deep Dish Chicago-style Pizza where every last bite (including the crust!) is delicious. I've frequented Unos numerous times in multiple cities including Orlando Rochester & Syracuse NY and of course the original Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due in Chicago. However the Uptown UNO in Charlotte is a disgrace to the UNO name. Twice now we've attempted to eat there only to be met with poor customer service skills at the hostess stand. The first time was an early evening and there were about 10 people (different parties) in line empty tables...and nobody being seated. After five minutes of not seeing any hostess we left. The second time we visited in the afternoon for lunch. We were pleased to see that there were people actually dining in there several empty tables and only one couple waiting to be seated. We watched as the first couple were seated. Needless to say the one hostess on duty never returned. Having watched her every step of the way in seating the last couple it seemed like she was just wandering through the restaurant aimlessly not doing much of anything. And she never acknowledged us previously either. We waited for about five minutes watching her not doing much of anything. That's when I took action and walked over to her to remind her that we were waiting to be seated. She unenthusiastically walked back to the hostess stand with me. She looked around at the several empty tables and said It'll be about 10 minutes. Enough was enough. We left. Do yourself a favor: Go to UNO when you're in ANY other city except Charlotte!
