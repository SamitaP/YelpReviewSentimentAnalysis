1 star for price and 1 star for atmosphere; however terrible service and run-of-the-mill foodTook forever to have our order taken followed by them not bringing my food out after everyone had already gotten their order. Never came by to fill our glasses. The food came out in a messed up order. Appetizers got there only 2 minutes before main course seriously? Once I got my sushi I had no tray for the soy sauce and no one was around to ask for one. The kicker the place wasn't busy not in the least bit.I will never return here when I come back to Charlotte.
