Some of the worst Chinese take out I've had in a long time.  I got the sesame chicken dinner combo. The chicken was overly breaded and very soggy.  The sesame sauce was bright red - as if they put the wrong sauce on my chicken and just threw some sesame seeds on top to make it look correct. I also had asked for brown rice but they don't carry steamed brown rice.It was very cheap - but I guess you get what you pay for.
