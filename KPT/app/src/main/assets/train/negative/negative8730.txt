This place was great for atmosphere and large groups but the food actually sucked.  We ordered from the happy hour appetizer menu and our server was pretty slow and forgetful. She brought one of us crab dip that was cold (supposed to be served hot) then took forever to bring the drinks back. I asked if the southwest egg rolls were very spicy before I ordered she said no and low and behold I get them and they are spicy.  The drink (margarita) was very strong and not sweet enough. Overall they get a D for food and an A for ambience and location.
