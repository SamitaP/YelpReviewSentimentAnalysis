I had some pretty high expectations for Umi since it claimed to be the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Those expectations kind of fell flat.Service here on a Saturday night was atrocious.  We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink and then another 20 min before we were asked what we would like to order.  Not OK.  On top of that our interactions with our waiter were just awkward.  Something seemed to be up like there was some tension going on with him and maybe the staff/kitchen?  As far as the sushi goes... it's pretty good.  I got some maki rolls which were very good but nothing spectacular.  Miso soup... OK.  Salad was OK.  The sashimi definitely seemed like a better option and something they took greater pride in.  The people next to us who had ordered some sashimi options and seemed quite satisfied.  If I come back again I'll make sure to order sashimi.  However I was so annoyed by the lack of service that I doubt I'll be back anytime soon.
