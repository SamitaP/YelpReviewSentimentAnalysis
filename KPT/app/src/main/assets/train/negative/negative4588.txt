Visiting Pittsburgh with my daughter we wanted to eat somewhere downtown and not walk too far.  Yelped this place  and chose it because it was close by and not because of the rating.  But it turns out that generally you can trust your fellow yelpers on this one.  We were seated immediately because it wasn't too crowded (bad sign). We sat by the window.  The best thing about this restaurant is the decor as it had a Thai motif on the wall a glass case with little Thai statues and a nice vase with a fake orchid on the table. nicely folded cloth napkin...etc  I didn't experience the bad service that others claimed but I can see how it might be possible because my service was quite mediocre.  Now segway to the food and I don't know how to explain this as bad service or inadequate food but we ordered the beef curry and it came with NO BEEF in it.  Did they think they could get away with it and we wouldn't notice? I figured it was just an oversight  that maybe we just looked like vegetarians because it's ridiculous for any restaurant to skimp on the food.  But then I got my chicken lemongrass soup. It was so tiny and there was hardly any chicken in it. I wanted a typical Thai soup called Tom Kha Gai but they never heard of it. But  please take a look at my photos and see how small the soup bowl is.  I placed the spoon on top for comparison and you will really see that the bowl is not much bigger than the spoon. Nuff said.
