Just way to expensive for what it is. It's good but not at the prices they choose. $9 for wedding soup? It was good but not at that price and if I would've been told it was that much (was a special) I would've passed. Service was fine but not attentive and slow as well. Just so many other good Italian places in the area for half the price. Eggplant parm was enjoyable.
