Not too shabby.  I would call it a finer diner in terms of the definition of a Diner.  The menu has your everyday American items; nothing too creative or imaginative.   It's pretty basic.  Salads sandwiches burgers and entrees we have all had before.The food is good though; however you're paying for the location and decor (which in our opinion was kind of out-dated).  We started with the mushroom flatbread that was a bit on the sweet side; however it was loaded with mushrooms which is a huge plus.I had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and Jordan had the reuben.  The salmon was very light and tasty and Jordan's corned beef was sliced real thick.  French fries are pretty standard.All in all I guess this is where the rich people of ShadySide get their diner food: same kind of food just a fancier ambiance than Denny's.  We will be back when we want something comforting but dont want to be surrounded by teenagers and want something better than Eat 'N Park.
