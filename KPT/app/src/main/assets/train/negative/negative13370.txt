Okay so I've eaten here a few times now and I feel it's time to review.  I'm not a fan really. Every food experience I've had here has been mediocre It's kind of like delivery Chinese food but Thai.  Now to describe my experience today... I ordered takeout for lunch as I was in a hurry to get back to the office.  Normally I would have ordered from another Thai restaurant around the corner but they seemed to be closed. So I decided to try Thai House again as my craving was strong. I seriously want to like this place but my pad see ew was just not very good. It was over cooked hardly any vegetables at all and I asked for spicy and there was no heat to my dish. The lunch special comes with a spring roll well it was more like half a spring roll haha. Which that was the least of my worries but it wasn't any good. It's supposed to have chicken clear noodles and mixed vegetables. It had what looked like bok choy and that was it!!  I have some friends who like this place and I've had good that was good but  nothing special here. Essentially for me it's like fast food quality.  I don't like giving poor reviews especially when the people there seem fairly nice if a little out of it but I just don't think I'll be back again!!
