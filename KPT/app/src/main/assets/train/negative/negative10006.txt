Horrible. This used to be a great place to grab some great breakfast and coffee and despite it always being busy the lines moved very quick and efficient.  It appears now they have an entire new crew including new managers.  Service quality and speed went way down.  I've tried coming back several times thinking the new staff will eventually improve but each time I wait longer and longer in much shorter lines and a majority of the bagel baskets are frequently empty leaving only 2 or three choices.It's clear I'm not the only one who has given up coming here frequently; this used to be a fun hangout spot as well but now the few people that come in just get there food to go as it is always empty (yet service is still very slow)
