- The bread was good and so was the spicy shrimp butter that came with it.- The lobster bisque had a very slight gummy texture to it as if too much flour had been used.  - I had the lobster pasta and I was a little disappointed with the lack of sauce that accompanied it.  It was really more of a broth than anything which made the pasta seem too soggy and also drippy and messy to eat.  My wife had the fillet mignon which she said was one of the best she's ever had.  She thought the potato side was just so-so.- Each of us had a drink with our meal which put our total at $115 including the tip.  I expect to be a little bit more wowed with a meal for that price.
