Don't know what the deal was but on a day with a car show across the street and a basketball game a couple blocks away we were one of about 3 parties which rolled up for lunch only to find the place closed. Who knows how many folks did the same thing considering the posted Saturday hours. Then again about half of Uptown was closed. CLT remains at heart a town by for and of bankers. Sad.
