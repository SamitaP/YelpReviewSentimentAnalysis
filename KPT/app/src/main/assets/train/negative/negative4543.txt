Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was the best pizza in the city.  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  If this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.
