The meal was good.  The usual chain steakhouse quality. ... except the 18 oz rib eye came with a 5 oz bone in it.....Typically the servers are at least attentive at the longhorn.  Today our server would have preferred she didn't have people to wait on.  The restaurant wasn't busy but getting a new drink was almost impossible....and you better be satisfied with the old mug cause getting a new frosty mug with the 2nd beer was not going to happen.
