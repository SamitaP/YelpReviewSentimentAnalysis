My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place for a long time. The food was great and the service was great! Everything started to fall apart once the original manager was forced to quit his position. The food quantity and quality started to go down hill. There was hair in my food not once but TWICE every time I order a rice dish. The new owner did not care to apologize and he was offended I even brought it up. The sushi is very plain and not high quality either. As a college student they forget to discount our meal from time to time but its the food that matters right? Their prices are constantly changing and for the amount of the food it is not reasonable. We will not be coming back at all. There are other places to go that actually care about their customers satisfaction.
