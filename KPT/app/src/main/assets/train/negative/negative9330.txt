I went here for a business lunch the other day and as a petite woman even I was shocked at how small the portions were.  I typically need a to go box whenever I go out to eat but here I finished my entire meal (trout and potatoes) and was still hungry.  We all ended up ordering dessert and laughed when we saw it.  The $7 cheesecake could fit on a tablespoon!  The service was pretty good in the beginning but as the place filled up our server seemed to disappear.  He never returned to refill our glasses or bring the missing ice cream that was supposed to go with my dessert!  While the restaurant interior is lovely and the location is great for all those that work in uptown the price you pay for the small amount of food makes it not worth it.
