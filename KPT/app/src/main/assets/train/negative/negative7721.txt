Jason's Deli on Centrum Parkway is always busy at lunch.  I have always eaten at their salad bar which is actually quite tiny.  For a salad buffet Souper Salad offers significantly more salad toppings and additional buffet options at a similar price.  I feel like I never get my money's worth at Jason's though the salads there are tasty and nutritious.
