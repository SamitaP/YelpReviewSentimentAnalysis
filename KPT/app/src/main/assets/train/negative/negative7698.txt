This has only been my 2nd time at a Red Lobster EVER. It was ok. I have had better seafood elsewhere. The biscuits were by far the star of the show. We were seated quickly for a Friday night and the server was fine.The seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter. Don't get me wrong I LOVE butter but  sometimes too much of a good thing can ruin a meal. The shrimp were TINY and the Lobster Tail was TINYIt was pricey too considering we had 2 Childrens Entr√©es. The kids mac and cheese was Kraft. Sort of a joke really. $599 for Mac and Cheese from a box. When are restaurants going to get a clue and offer more than chicken fingers and mac and cheese on the kids menu? Some kids do have an adventurous spirit and will eat real food.I may go back for a lunch and their biscuits but will probably pass on them for dinner.
