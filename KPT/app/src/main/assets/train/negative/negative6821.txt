I recently had a horrible experience at Girasole. I used to really enjoy going to this restaurant due to its cozy atmosphere and decent Italian food. However this past visit was unfortunate. The host was horrendous and extremely rude. I had brought my parents who were visiting from out of town and they were appalled at how rude the host was. Girasole is usually quite busy but it was also disorganized. I had made a reservation and arrived early knowing that there would be a wait. However we saw three tables be seated prior to us all of which had arrived much after us. When we tried to tell the hostess he was even more rude than when we had arrived. To be honest I could have overlooked the seating other parties prior to us if we had at least been given a friendly smile or a warm welcome. Regarding the food it is adequate nothing in comparison to other much more exciting and fulfilling Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.
