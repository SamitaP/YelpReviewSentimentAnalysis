They get two for the great service but everything else was not so good. I had a ribeye which was cooked to the right temperature. It was seasoned with a TON of salt and a pound of butter. Sweet potato also had too much butter. My gf got the lobster chops the lobster was overcooked and tough to get out of the shell. It should be easy when it comes split already right? Her corn on the cob was undercooked. So all in all the service is good but the food sucks. We will not be coming back again.
