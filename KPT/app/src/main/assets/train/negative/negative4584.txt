terrible service is right.  the minute my coworker and i walked in the host (i think the teenage son of the owner?) was just rude.  he was going to give us the table closest to the register where people are always walking in and out.  my coworker asked to be seated at one of the other 8 tables that were open.  he mumbled something but then let us grab another table.  and when he served the dishes he pretty much was throwing them onto the table.the wonton soup was horrible.  the wonton itself was pretty much all dough (not even cooked all the way thru) and i don't even want to speculate what the tiny meat in it was made of.  i've also tried the house soup which is just water with tomotoes in it.  for my entree i had the green curry w/chicken which actually wasn't as bad as the service but that's not saying much at all.sad that this is one of the few places for asian food in the pitts...
