We came for steaks. Mistake. Probably great burgers (if you read the reviews) but that's it. They don't know how to cook steaks unless you like hockey pucks. They also have a wind problem every time the front door is open. Finally a supposed owner that works as hostess needs to concentrate on her job and learn how a restaurant is run. We won't go back.
