I almost hate writing this review because Green's is such a Charlotte institution. I almost feel like I'm dissing my adopted city by saying this but I just don't see what the big deal is about this place. When I first moved here everyone talked about how the hot dogs were as good as The Varsity in Atlanta. News tip: they aren't and they aren't by a longshot. What's worse the three or four times I've eaten there the food has been lukewarm and inconsistent. Maybe the hot dog is cold but the chili is hot. I dunno... I WANT to like this place but just can't.
