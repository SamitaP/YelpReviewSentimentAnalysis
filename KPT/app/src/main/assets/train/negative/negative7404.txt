Man this place is a dump. If you're not a local or regular good luck feeling comfortable there. It is obviously a local bar first and restaurant second. Certainly not for the ladies or kids. The pierogies were indeed delish and the fish sammo was okay. It was cooked nicely but the fish wasn't all that fresh and you could tell. Btw I did not pre-order pierogies and I got mine no problem. But it wasn't during peak hours. As noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender. A bit gruff but I've had worse. Music was BLASTING non-stop during my hour there. A Nickelback fan's dream com true. Smoky but not horribly so. If you're a local rummy barfly then this place is for you! But if you're a DDD fan you might want to move on to another DDD spot in Pittsburgh. Not sure why it would be featured on the show. Nadine's was better and they made you feel welcome.
