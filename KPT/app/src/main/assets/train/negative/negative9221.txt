After participating in the Charlotte heart walk my friends and I went to Mert's for brunch. We knew the service probably wouldn't be that great but expected the food to make up for that. Big fail on that expectation. The collard greens were dry with no flavor and when someone on my party asked if she could exchange them for something else the waitress caught an attitude. Whenever we would ask for something it was almost like a mother may I situation. We didn't know if her reaction would be positive or negative. The manager seemed to not care about our situation and just left everything up to the waitress. After paying my bill I waited for my change that never came. I ended up asking for the manager to find out where the waitress went with my money. After the manager asked the waitress the waitress states she already gave me my change  after reminding her that she didn't give me anything she states oh then I have your money right here! It was in her pocket. Not sure how she could have forgotten that she owed me more than $10!! Especially since the tip was already included in the bill! Never going back and I will never recommend this place to anyone. Even if I do have a living social coupon!!
