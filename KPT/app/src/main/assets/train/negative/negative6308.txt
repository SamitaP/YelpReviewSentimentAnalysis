I would prefer to leave 2.5 stars.  I ordered the kimchi pancakes and a salad I think.  The pancakes were ok a little mushy but flavorful.  I wish I could remember the other thing but it was better.  The kicker was when I ordered a glass of Laphroaig.  When the bill comes it is 75 dollars.  Apparently the only Laphroaig they have is 30 years old and no longer being produced.  And is 50 dollars a glass.  Drinking Scotch in Pittsburgh has been fun so far.
