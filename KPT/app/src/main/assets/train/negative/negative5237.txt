The burger was pretty good but I've had much better. Tables are really close to each other like others have said. What I really didn't like about this place was the service. We had to flag down our waitress just to get refills. We were rushed through our meals like we weren't wanted! I mean they weren't crowded or anything. There was one other table of people besides us on the dining side and maybe 10 people at the bar. I should have went to Five Guy's! I would have been much happier!
