I'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience. We tried to order a pitcher of the IPA and the waitress stops us and is like do you like IPAS? do you know what your ordering? i was like yes i like IPAS im capable of ordering a beer like a grown up. maybe next time be like hey our ipa is exceptionally hoppy compared to other ipas is that alright for you? After finally ordering a pitcher of beer (there were six of us so four of us had one beer) the waitress tells us that it is such a high gravity she says 9% that if any of us have more than three she'll have to start figuring out who the DD is and maybe cut people off. Not only was it an uncomfortable comment but we looked back at the menu and the beer was only 5.7%. Needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks. Then when the waitress brought out our chili she told us that the green onions looked nasty and she didn't feel comfortable serving them. I was kind of grossed out by that point. Couldn't you have just lied to me and told me you were out? I don't wanna hear about nasty things in the kitchen it made me really not want to eat. Luckily the food was good however the service was reason enough not to return.
