Okay Thai food nothing special and overpriced. Ordered the eggplant with shrimp veggie fried rice and chicken satay. Eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp. The veggie fried rice and chicken satay were both substandard as far as other Thai food restaurants in the area. It is pricier than most other Thai places in the area and based on the quality I would not recommend.
