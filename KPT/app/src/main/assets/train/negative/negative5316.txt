I have heard a good amount of positive reviews of this place from lots of different people. That being said I was expecting to be wowed by their burgers which is the reason people told me to go. However when I arrived with my guest 8:00 PM on Thursday night I was kind of disappointed. Not only did the waitress take a good 10 minutes before she brought us water but she was not very attentive and never checked back with us until she brought the bill. The burger was so-so with little flavor which was very disappointing. I could also tell that a few other tables in my section were looking around waiting for their server.All in all I was disappointed by the quality of food as well as the service.
