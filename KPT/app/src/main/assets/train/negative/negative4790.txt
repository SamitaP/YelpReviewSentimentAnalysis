I had such high hopes. And though they clearly pride themselves in their pasta and ravioli mine fell apart like crazy. It was a mess. An expensive mess. Artichoke and Gorgonzola everywhere. Not only the seams fell apart. The pasta broke all over. I may go back for tiramisu in time but I'll definitely hesitate before spending 9 bucks on a dozen pieces of watery mess again.
