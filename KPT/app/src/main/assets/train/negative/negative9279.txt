Pros:Great ambianceService was friendly and attentiveCons:Kettle one with soda - everyone knows that's soda water right??? not 7-up gross.Salt salt salt....we ordered the halibut and the veal but we couldn't tell the difference all we could taste was salt.Two salty entrees two cocktails two salads = $130...ouch no thanks.I have four more days in this beautiful city let's see what else I can find...
