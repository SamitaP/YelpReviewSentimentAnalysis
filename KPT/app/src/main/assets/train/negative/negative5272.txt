My boyfriend and I went here for burgers because there are so many good reviews and we heard that they're the best in the 'burgh.  I was disappointed.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay.  Maybe my expectations are too high but I don't want a burger that's purely a slab of ground beef with no seasoning or other flavoring in it.  I've had more flavorful burgers at chain restaurants.I did like the home fries very yummy!  And an interesting side dish.
