This place is terrible. We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. Our waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. The main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience.
