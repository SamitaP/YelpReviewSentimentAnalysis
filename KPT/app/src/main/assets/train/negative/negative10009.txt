This seems to be one of the many places in Charlotte where it comes highly recommended impresses you on first entry into the restaurant with the decor waters your palette at first sight of the menu and then leaves you feeling very unsatisfied when the actual meal comes.  A beautifully presented restaurant menu and plate of food....but they seemingly forget that what brings people back is the actual preparation of the food and the ingredients used.  I had the calamari and tuna and both were poorly cooked underseasoned and the ingredients did not taste fresh or well selected.  Will not go back.  In Charlotte you have a lot of bad imitations of fine restaurants.  This is another one.  For fine dining in Charlotte I would stick with The Palm Capital Grille Ruth Chris Morton's etc....  If you are really craving seafood I would go with Upstream instead.
