This is my first yelp review. I set up a account just for this review.  I was deeply sadden by the food I received today. I first started coming here since 1993. I have moved to Midwest four years later. However  every times I drive thru PittsburghI always stopped here. I really enjoy the general Tso' s chicken. As part of preparation chicken was fried ahead of timeand fried again when you order That is why their general Tso's Chicken was so crispy and aromatic when served. I did not have to make this stop but after driving 450 miles I wanted a decent meal.Well I stopped by and order the Dish for carry out. When I open them(it was not long 30 minutes or less) they were so soggy and based on my experience who grew up on Chinese food it was not fried the second time. The difference? They tasted worse than Buffet dish sitting above the steamer for hours. Furthermore I have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce. Shrimp was hard to chew. It seems like the shrimp the simmered in the sauce for ages. There was no aroma from garlic or onion. Being a decent cook myself I can tell you those dishes I ordered were not cooked by the main chef or secondary chef. I suspect this is  probably made by the guy who station the fryer. Truly the taste of those two dishes were so awful I toss them out. I purchase those passing Pittsburgh not really possible asking for refund.I have had so much memory with this place. Rest assured I won't be coming ever. It was so bad I would not dear to try again. I do hope the owner sees this and make a statement of this incident. I eager to see you standby your dishes again. If I see owner's rebuttal I would love to call the owner to discuss this encounter further and willing to be convinced to come back.Sincerely
