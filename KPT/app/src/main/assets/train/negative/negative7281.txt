Had a craving for Chinese the other day while I was in Shadyside and wandered into China Palace.  How this place can stay in business in an area that I consider to be more sophisticated is a real mystery.  It was just awful and the service was terrible.I wanted to have the assorted appetizer platter but asked if I could substitute one of the items with dumplings.  Our waiter had to ask the manager.  After much whispering the manager came back to me and told me that I could have dumplings...then I asked if I could get the fried dumplings with that instead of steamed.   Well I was met with an outraged NO!!!!  It kind of surprised me that I got this kind of reaction.  I was told that the chef would have to fry 2 dumplings just for my platter.  I looked around and there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant.  Isn't that what they're supposed to do?  Cook food for people to eat?  I would have never asked if I thought it would be such a big deal.  Anyway the food was not very good.  In fact it was awful.  Were they having an off day?   I'm not sure they were.   There's never any reason to be rude to your patrons.  No need to ever return.
