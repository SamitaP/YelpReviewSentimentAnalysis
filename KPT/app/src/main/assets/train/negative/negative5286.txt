I can't figure out the hype surrounding the burgers here.  It's at or near the top of more Best Burger in Pittsburgh lists than not and some people have gone so far as to name it the best burger in the state.  I've had burgers at well over 100 places in this state and let me tell you Tessaro's isn't even average.The ingredients were of good quality but both creativity in design and skill in preparation were sorely lacking.  I went with a group of five and not one of us enjoyed the burger.  Also not one of us got ours cooked as ordered.  I'm willing to accept a variety of interpretations of medium rare but no pink and dry throughout is not one of them.Though shamefully mistreated the meat's natural flavor along with non-burger items rescued Tessaro's from one star territory but it was pretty obvious the clueless kitchen couldn't hold up to real competition.  (If you want a decent burger try Burgatory.)
