This will be simple...The karaoke had a very limited selection. The DJ kept fiddling with the volume while you were singing. Was way over-crowded with wanna-be hipsters who were attempting to be ironic which just made them look pathetic especially since they kept taking pictures to most likely show Facebook people how much fun they were having and how great they are.There was only one server for a bar packed with people and was hard to get a drink.Won't be going back.
