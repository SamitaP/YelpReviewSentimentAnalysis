Bland is probably the key word in describing this place. A local Applebees-type feel.I was here for dinner one night and the sandwich I got was unbelievably bland so was the side of cole slaw. The artichoke dip was ok but very greasy. The pasta a bit dry and bland as well.The reverse happy hour concept from 9PM-11PM is cool. There is an OK number of beers on tap. The service is friendly and efficient.However the food is sub-par so I won't be returning even if I were in the area.
