Huge disappointment.I wanted a real deli sandwich (not Subway).  I thought I'd give this place a try.  $10.00 got me a 6 meatball sub on a white bun Lay's potato chips and a pickle spear with a regular soda.  The sub was not one bit better than Subway.  This was a complete waste of my time and money.  I could have had the same exact thing (sans the pickle) and chosen my own chips from a variety.  They have a lot of food on the menu; I have no idea how the soups salads etc. are.  All I know is that I couldn't even find a list of the types of bread they offer on the menu.  This place is hard to navigate and the food quality is not worth the trouble.UPDATE:  Went back for lunch (at a friend's request) on Tuesday (11/1).  I had the chicken club salad and a cup of the Southwestern Chicken Chili.  Both were quite good.  My bill:  $14.90.  I'll up the rating to 2 stars as the food is OK (not great) but it is WAY overpriced.
