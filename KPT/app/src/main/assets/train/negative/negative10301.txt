Dining out is like dating. You can go out once and have no desire to ever go out again. Or you can fall in love and find reason to be back daily. Although I found the menu to offer a nice variety and the food was well presented I can't say I was overly blown away by my dinner experience. While Lamar was extremely knowledgeable and selected a nice wine within our price range I wasn't particularly tickled by the overall meal. Kind of like a good looking guy that dresses well and says the right things but is just... blah. My filet was cooked to perfection and the bite sized nibbles of my friends meals proved to be tasty. The hummus platter offered a nice variety and Lamar immediately replenished the warm pita bread upon seeing our empty basket. Everything was done properly up to expectation with no hassle or complaint to give yet I walked away with a very average feel. Just like the guy that you have so much in common with your mom likes your friends approve but you're really not that into him. I think there are better fish out in the sea for me than Blue.
