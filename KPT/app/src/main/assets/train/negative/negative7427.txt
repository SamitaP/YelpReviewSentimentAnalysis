I get take-out from here occasionally purely out of convenience and lack of competition.  During my last pick-up the evening of 6-22-12 I witnessed a patron quietly complaining about the confusion and lack of separation between those waiting to pay waiting for an order and waiting to be seated.  The front waiting area was in mass confusion.  The response from the manager on duty was to insult the patron saying grown men should be able to wait on pizza and basically I don't care.  This is not an acceptable response for management.  The quality of our pizza is mediocre at best with the toppings being more than 2 inches from the edge on a hand tossed pizza.  The lady at the register was friendly as usual.This Pizza Hut is not a top choice but ok in a pinch.
