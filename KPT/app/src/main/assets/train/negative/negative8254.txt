We decided to change-up our Ruth's Chris experience with another high rated steakhouse. Just like any night out to dinner we dressed up with a nice top and jeans which happened to be the wrong style for the hostess at Morton's. After checking in with the girl at the front an unnamed judgmental man who sat us at our table made a judgmental comment Oh jeans I see... making both my girlfriend and I uneasy and uncomfortable about the rest of our experience. The drinks were average and the steaks were good but not fabulous. In fairness our waiter was very friendly though.Unfortunately our friendly waiter was not enough to overcome our bad initial impression.  I expected better especially at a nice restaurant like this.When people are attempting to come into your establishment and spend over $150 on dinner you should do whatever you can to make them feel as comfortable as possible.  Now I am sure never to return back to Morton's and I tell everyone I know about my negative experience.
