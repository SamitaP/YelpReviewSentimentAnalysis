Came in with a buddy of mine to a familiar place that always delivers during my travels. We sat down not too many clients in the restaurant and service started out well with our server Imani. However it became evident that either we were placed in a section different from the areas she was working as we kept seeing her less and less or I can just ignore my guest because I think I'm cute and smile and everything will be okay. At the end of our meal which was very good she offered us dessert we opted for another beer which never came. We would catch a glance here and there of her for the next 20 minutes and finally she came over and asked if I beer made it to us. Did you bring me my drink? Then no I have not gotten my beer. She would look for it right away but I asked her to just close us out as it just wasn't nice to be there any longer no excuse no apology just said okay smiling away and walked away to what I hoped would be a quick return with my bill. She again left for another 10 minutes. When she returned I asked her what exactly happened that our drinks never made it to us? Was someone else supposed to bring it did she forget? She said that someone else usually brings it she was helping out the bar by bringing our drinks someone must have taken it oh my god i'll just smile at these guys and everything will be fine.... no.... i just want good service. The server who was on our side was taking care of all his clients bringing them drinks so im pretty sure I was getting the run around. I asked her who the manager was and she said Michael and again walked away. Pretty disrespectful attitude to have in a customer service environment. Next time I come to Charlotte I need to stick to the many many other places with great food and folks that want to take care of their clients. My opinion is that the food here was darn good and consistent the beer is excellent the service which is the most important was rock bottom.
