Tonight's review: it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables. Yes there were five other more comfortable two tops available. We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. Punishment was fast...we sipped our water were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages. With plenty of time to review the night's menu we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment. YES I will return and still recommend Casbah. Oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order.  M
