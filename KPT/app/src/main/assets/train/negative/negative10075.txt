Recently had lunch at Cosmos Cafe in uptown. I ordered the Steak Frites and wasn't asked how I'd like the steak cooked. It came prepared okay but the meat was exceptionally gristly.Food and service alone would be a perfectly average 3-stars. However we were seated next to some piece of wall art at a two-top. A large flying type of bug (flying ant maybe?) made it's way onto our table twice from underneath the wall art. I flicked it to the floor and about two minutes later another one emerged from behind the art hovering next to our table. I could imagine the first one was a wayward insect that had flown in the restaurant but when I saw a second one I began to suspect that there might be an infestation in the restaurant. I won't be dining at this Cosmos location again.
