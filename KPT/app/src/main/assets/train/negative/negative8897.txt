Well--after I was done and I didn't finish half my plate I decided not to take home the rest and wished I didn't eat the calories I ate the catfish wasn't worth it. I decided to give them one last try on a slice of pound cake to take home with me. It was wrapped up in Saran wrap and put in a box when i opened it the texture was dry and hard and it wasn't big enough to charge almost $4...  there were flies everywhere. I won't be back anytime soon
