Il piz is a Mt lebo staple but not that great.  We ordered the bucatini americano and a pizza.  The bucatini was good but not a great value.  I was excited about the pizza because they cook it in a brick oven which should make a great pie but was disappointed when it came out soggy.  Should have been nice and crisp.  There weren't even many toppings to make it soggy.  probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices.
