The appetizer was bruschetta.  Essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings.  Two of the three were good but the brocolinni topped one was not my taste.  Certainly this was NOT worth the $12 price.  Our dinner was pizza.  The crust was very good - almost like a soft warm flat breadstick.  Sadly the pizza was sparsely topped with cheese and sausage.Our server was attentive almost to a fault.  The restaurant was excessively loud - we couldn't hear the waitress rattle off the soup appetizer or entree specials (seven specials in total).While the food was not bad I can't justify the prices or quantities.  In fact I really didn't pull up Yelp to rate this restaurant...I'm actually looking for a place to go eat since I'm still famished after eating here.
