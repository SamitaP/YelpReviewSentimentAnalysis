Literally the worst restaurant experience that I've ever had including McDonald's and 24-hour scarf-and-barf diners.Pittsburgh is undergoing a bit of a food renaissance yet the Original Fish Market continues to put out an inferior product in a horrendous atmosphere at an obscene price.  Our fish was tasteless and rubbery my white wine came out at room temperature the restaurant was extremely dirty and our server was clearly apathetic.  The Original Fish Market opened in 1998 and quickly found a place in the market in a city where Red Lobster was still considered good seafood.  As top-notch restaurants entered the market the local palates grew up in a big way.  The Original Fish Market seems content to remain frozen in time competing as a mediocre option in an under served market space.  Unfortunately for them their market space is now flooded with options offering a far superior product  at a fraction of the price.
