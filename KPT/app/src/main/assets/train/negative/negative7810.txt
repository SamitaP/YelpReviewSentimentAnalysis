Maybe I'm spoiled by the Longhorn near my house which is always good...When I arrived at 7:30pm on a Sunday evening I was treated as if the restaurant was about to close.  The hostess was very short with me and my date.  She walked us to a table dropped the menus and walked away.The server (never told us his name) came by the table and got our drink order.  No personality and didn't make us feel welcome.  We ordered eventually.  No personality still.  (Are they closing soon?)Dinner arrived and my steak didn't taste right.  My date didn't like her steak either.  The manager came by and offered next to nothing to make things right.  I eventually requested some A1 and dowsed my steak in that.The best part of dinner was the sweet tea.
