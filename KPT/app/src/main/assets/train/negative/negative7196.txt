The two stars are for the food only. Otherwise negative stars would  be in effect. WHO on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to? What a completely miserable experience. The bitchy emo service obviously leaves something to be desired then again so does the ENTIRE restaurant! Sure melted cheese in a crepe is good. Know what else is good? ANY melted cheese from any breakfast place and Not having to endure this hell hole. I am just upset that I went there in the early part of my day and am now in a foul mood as a result. I have been in Pittsburgh a few weeks and this place is without rival the worst brunch I've ever had (PA or CA) So the one positive thing about it IS.... it has made me appreciate every other sub par brunch I've had up until this point.  Absolutely will never return. EVEN THE Orange juice was bad. Are you kidding?
