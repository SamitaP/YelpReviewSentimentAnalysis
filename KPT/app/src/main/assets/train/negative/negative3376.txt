Monte Cellos is located fairly close to my work and so I've gone a few times.  Each time I ask myself Why am I going back?Mediocre dish after Mediocre dish somehow I think it will get better next time.Last time I had a Grilled Chicken Salad that they're known for --- at least that's what the cashier said.  It was grilled chicken french fries a little cheese on chopped lettuce. Can you say B-O-R-I-N-G?Today I had a steak hoagie.  Enough places in Pittsburgh do these that comparing them is easy.  While the bread is fresh and the hoagie buns are huge --- it's all downhill from here.  Enter three slices of steak-ums and the contents of the hoagie are just flat. The bread is 90% of the meal. Unmemorable.I was happy with the pizza I had there but for salads and hoagies? Not so much.
