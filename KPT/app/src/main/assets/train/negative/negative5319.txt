I want to go back to give it a better review but here is my experience. I called ahead and asked if they had highchairs. When we showed up they only had booster seats. 3 years ago I wouldn't have known the difference but after spending 2 minutes watching my 1.5 year old thrash around I can tell you their is a big difference. The waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him. Yelp says good for kids they said we have a high chair. The waitress was about as warm and friendly as a night in spent sleeping in the snow naked. The potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par. The burgers are big and if you looking for a giant patty of cheap meat then this is your place. I feel bad because unlike most places I give two stars I really want to like this place.
