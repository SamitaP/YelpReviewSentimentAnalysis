We had to come try this place out since it had amazing reviews. We were disappointed TWICE!..The service was great both times.  We had carryout the first time and ate in the second.  The place was busy both times and the Chicken wings were the only thing that was consistently good.  The Collard Greens are the toughest and tasteless greens I've ever had and the Mac & Cheese is so so.  My Husband had the fried whiting and it was tasty but he also didn't like the sides and said the greens were gritty. We both agree that the cornbread is delicious.  I would return for the Chicken Wings only.
