I have been here on numerous occasions with a variety of people and the one thing I must say about this place is inconsistency.  You can go there one night and have great food and service whereas you could go there on a totally different night and experience the complete opposite.  The same goes for the food.  Some dishes are awesome (shrimp and grits stuffed chicken) while others I would definitely shy away from (pizza).  If you are a beer lover they have some good brews which are actually crafted on site.  The beer can be better than the food more times than not and I would recommend people to go here for that more than the food.  The Southern Flyer is great for pale ale folks like myself.  If you give this place a shot prepare to roll the dice because you don't know who you will get or what the food will be like when it comes out.  The one thing you will be guaranteed to have if you are so inclined is a nice brew made on-site.  Can't beat that sometimes...
