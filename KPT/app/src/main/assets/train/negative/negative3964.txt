Just returned from RFBlues where I usually enjoy myself quite a lot.The bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer. No bigdeal; pink salmon looks a lot like white chicken assuming she'scolorblind. I waited.And had a 2nd drink.Another group of 3 people came in after that ordered their meals andgot served their entrees.I went up to the bartender and asked when my dinner would be coming.She announced that salmon takes longer to cook (than what??? a rawsalad? I cook; salmon is one of the fastest things on earth to cook!)and that I was about to check on that... It had been over an hour bynow.I got my sandwich promptly after complaining.A few minutes later when I finished my salmon I got my side ofvegetables (apparently vegetables take even longer than salmon tocook!).All sarcasm aside: one screw up is tolerable. The second - forgettingto even check on my late order until I complained an hour after Iordered is not. And yet I wasn't given the least consideration inthe bill.
