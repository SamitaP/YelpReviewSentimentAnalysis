First of all the decor is very nice and the service is great.  But none of that is any good if the food isn't up to par!  And the food is NOT up to par.  I ordered the Rock House Farm Artisan Pork which turned out to be teeny slices of unseasoned chewy pork loin layered with collard greens some mac and cheese a cube of fried pork belly with a greasy dab of something they call Arkansas black apple sauce. The collard greens were great and the mac and cheese were great but the rest was not worth eating.  All for $27.  Folks pork loin is not expensive and should always be tender and bountiful.  And don't give me a cube of fried pork belly and call it braised smokey bacon.  The Arkansas black apple sauce makes me never want to go to Arkansas.The two stars are based on the nice decor and excellent service.  But the food was not so great.
