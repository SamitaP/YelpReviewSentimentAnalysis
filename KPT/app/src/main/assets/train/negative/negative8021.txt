This is one of those places where the hype is bigger than reality.  Sure it's an institution of a business that somehow survived the times without changing the decor for decades.  But the hot dogs aren't impressive at all I was actually quite disappointed by them.  In my order I got two Carolina Style Dogs (mustard onions slaw and chili) with fries and a drink.  The drink is inundated with tons of ice which quickly waters down any flavor the soda may have had.  The fries were so-so nothing fancy about crinkle-cut.  The dogs were disappointing... since the hot dogs are cooked in a water pot they should be dried off a little before putting in the bun; well they didn't do that and I had a soggy buns as a result.  The slaw and chili didn't have any real flavor to them and probably would have been better without because of the mess.  Overall I couldn't finish both dogs because it got too messy and tasted blah with the wet bun.Honestly I have had better hot dogs from the Green's lunch cart located in front of Wells Fargo than the actual location.  Prices are the same cheap and that lady doesn't mess around with soggy buns.  If you want Green's lunch go to the cart not the establishment.  Overall there are better hot dog places in Uptown though will cost more.
