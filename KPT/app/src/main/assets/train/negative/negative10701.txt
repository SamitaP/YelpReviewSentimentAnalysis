Been to Mamas dozens of times over the past 10 years.The last few times out experience was just fair.Last night we went there for a birthday dinner...mistake1st thing they put the 7 of us in a small table for 6 max...how to you have any room for the food? DUH (plus the place was not even busy)They did accommodate us after my request to put 2 tables together.We ordered a few appetizers to start...one of them being the mozzarella and tomatoes we ordered the big portion and asked for the red peppers addition as usual. The order came to the table with 3 small slices of mozzarella and banana peppers. I again had to request a correction. I don't mind paying restaurant markups...but come on a few tomatoes and the paltry amount of cheese for like 9 bucks...shame on you.When the entrees came the runner looks at us like make room. Of course the table was full because the the app and salad courses had not been cleared.Going to a restaurant should not be about correcting step by step...it should be about having relaxing and fun time.There are many good choices in Charlotte unfortunately Mama Ricottas looks like it may no longer be one of them.
