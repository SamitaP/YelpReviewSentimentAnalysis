I have been robbed twice by the Saloon.  Someone there likes to write in tips so if you use a credit or debit card at the Saloon make ABSOLUTELY sure that you check you bank statement the next day. After the first time I wrote it up as a mistake on my part or their but the last time I was flabbergasted.  I went in on some Yeungling special night ordered one beer and wrote a dollar tip.  The next morning I checked my statement and I had been charged 25.00 for that single beer.  This is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud.  But they will keep saying it was an 'accident' as long as they can get away with it.  If you do have to go here I IMPLORE you to only use cash and look at your change carefully. This bar should be your absolute last resort in Mt Lebanon.At closing time as well get ready for the Mt Lebo Police Dpt to pull up outside and start hassling people who are WALKING HOME.  There are other great bars in Mt Lebanon that are far more deserving of your money.
