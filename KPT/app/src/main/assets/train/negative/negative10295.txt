Pricey and just mediocre in service food quality and atmosphere. Went on Sunday January 31 the last evening of the Dining Out Charlotte special event dinner for $30.  Two couples we brought our own wine and bill still came to $100 per couple. And the three others with me all had the Ragout dish and ALL three were sick to their stomachs throughout that night into the next evening. There are way better restaurants in Charlotte for the price.  Footnote -- the restaurant was nearly empty due to the weather.  You would think the manager would have come by the table to ask us about our dining experience.  He or she never appeared...do they even care?
