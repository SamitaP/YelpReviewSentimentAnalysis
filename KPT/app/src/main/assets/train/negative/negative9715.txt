I'd like to say it's a relative thing (I've had LOTS of really good and different types of pizza) but this was an ABSOLUTE thing - just really bad.  We had two pizzas - a classic (it was fine) and a new-age (Buffalo chicken).  The problems: crust had zero flavor the ingredients covered MAYBE 30% of the surface and maybe that was a good thing because they too lacked any real flavor.And then there was the service - incredible slow with lots of excuses (sorry - the bar got really crazy....and there was nothing crazy about it).The only thing good was the above par beer list which we were forced to wait FOREVER to get our beer.  Bizarre.DONT GO HERE!
