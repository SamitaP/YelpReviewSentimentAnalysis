I wasn't really a fan. In fact this may hae been some of the most sub-par Italian food I've had (it seemed very touristy) and it was definitely my least favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh while traveling there on business the past few months. Cute ambiance! Cute neighborhood! Friendly local wait staff! But kinda touristy & uninteresting food pairings / ingredients.
