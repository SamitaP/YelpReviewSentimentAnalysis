Been here twice; both times it was an awful experience. In both cases the trouble started with the hostess continued through poor/nonexistent service. On this occasion there was a cover for the privilege of listening to a lousy cover band playing tired seventies tunes in a room with terrible acoustics--apparently without a soundboard--and putting down money on overpriced drinks surrounded by frat boys guidos and gold diggers in addition to the aforementioned problems. I'd write a more entertaining review but honestly it's not worth the effort.
