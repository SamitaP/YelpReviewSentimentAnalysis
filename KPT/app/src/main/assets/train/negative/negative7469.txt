It is your standard-issue Chinese joint complete with the same menu food pictures employees with the minimum English clarity that you find at all of these places.For the first time since moving to the Belmont area i craved some Chinese. i had noticed this little Chinese joint next to the Papa Johns in the Bi-Lo shopping strip and we decided to give it a try. We were waiting for a car to get done with an oil change so we opted to eat inside this little place. Had we gotten takeout it may have been 3 stars because the food wasn't too shabby. Pretty standard General Tso chicken although the broccoli was as cold as the seating area which required us to wear our jackets. Surprisingly they didn't overcharge for a canned beverage and they did have a self-serve tea station. While we were eating we heard one of the cooks make the most obscene throat clearing noise that you usually only hear in the movies. It sounded like he was struggling to bring up a major loogie that was trapped deep within his soul. Fortunately we already had our food. If you're desperate for Chinese get it to go.
