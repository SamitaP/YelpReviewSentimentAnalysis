Growing up in pittsburgh I heard a lot of good things about this place but it must have gone down hill over the years. First off the area we were sat in was anything but a place you would go for a nice dinner with a giant TV and no table clothes it basically felt like your typical bar restaurant. Including a few flys to annoy you.We were served by a waitress who was generally not interested in waiting on us sitting us down handing us a paper and said here is our specials and walked away. She also was singing have the time walking around and mumbling to herself.I could deal with that if the food was good but it was far from it I ordered and itialian platter that had a piece of lasagna that had parts that were hard as a brick and clearly seemed microwaved. Then it had a portion of chicken parm and the chicken was paper thin and again hard and dried out.My gf ordered the Chicken Romano and it eh alright it was kinda soggy not the best but not the worst for her order.for what you pay and what you get just avoid it not worth trying over priced and just bad food.
