It has been years sense we visited the spaghetti warehouse my husband and I couldn't remember why we haven't been back. We had purchased a groupon for this place and decided to try it for an early dinner... Our first step in the restaurant and then it hit us on why we haven't returned.. The odd smell hits you at first step in the restaurant  you look around in the foyer and you see weird and dilapidated pictures a candy stand that probably hasn't been used in years.. We get seated in a booth with one side ripped and the other side stained our waitress was nice but that is far as she went. The food is mediocre at best the bread and the endless salad was the saving grace of dinner... We wanted to enjoy this place and tried to have a good time we would not recommend this place to anyone... There are plenty of other good restaurants in the strip and in lawrenceville..
