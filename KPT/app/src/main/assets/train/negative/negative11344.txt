So about 10 years ago I was taken to Cajun Queen by some friends when I moved here to Charlotte from Chicago. Remembering that I was not crazy about it I still was open to going again to re try it. I searched through all the Yelp reviews to see what to order and what was the best. First...this old House or Restaurant should be updated..obviously with the amount of people in it  at the time I left...they have the money. Stair case is wiggley..and it is just plain old..Not quaint and old ..just old.We were a big party and we had a good server named IVY but the food left lots to be desired. We were kindly treated by our hosts to almost ever single one of the appetizers to begin with. This started with Fried Oysters that were for sure fried a couple of days ago and then reheated in a microwave! ..Fried Green tomatoes were straight out of frozen bag and not fried..just barely baked..still cold in the middle..very bland. The New Orleans style Barbequed Shrimp....tiny little salad size and in the same sauce that everything including the gumbo had. I am going to spare you anymore..but to tell you It will for sure be another 10 years before I go back...thank goodness the company was fantastic!!
