Here before Bucs VICTORY OVER THE CARDS in game 3 of the NLDS a Sunday. Game at 4:30 got here at 2:30. Packed both inside and out. Can't comment on any other time but this really hectic one. Ordered Pepsi and brisket nachos. AWFUL. Soggy chips some shredded beef drenched in sweet generic BBQ sauce a blanket of cold congealed cheese spotted with jalape√±o slices. Not a degree above room temp. Will give them 1 star for tasty Pepsi and keeping it filled.
