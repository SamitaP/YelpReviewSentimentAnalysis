Mother's Dy Brunch- 3 adults and 1 child - 180.00 - only drinks were 2 waters and 2 teas-  gratuity was included in bill - so service was barely passable.  Food was okay - but not worth the price charged.  However - the crepes were awesome - the saving grace.  The entertainment was good and the atmosphere fine.  Probably would NOT go back.  Don't see a good value.  Do not recommend.
