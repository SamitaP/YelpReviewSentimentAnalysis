I've given this place enough 2nd chances and have had my last meal at this DIVE.Food is mediocre at best and you can't get any service because the wait staff is always outside having a cigarette. Very unappetizing to watchthem and the cook smoking then come back inside and NOT WASH THEIRHANDS. DISGUSTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!
