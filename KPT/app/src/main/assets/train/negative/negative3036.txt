The italian coldcut sub was a travesty! Lots of STALE bread with skimpy meat portions and no hots or flavor. Bread better suited for pigeons than people. I can find better Italian sandwiches back home in Baltimore. We'll feed these to our dogs when we get home.  You get what you pay for. Avoid this tourist trap!
