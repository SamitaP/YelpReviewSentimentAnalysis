We had heard good things about this little neighborhood bar good beer selection (check) cheerful service (check) good prices on drinks (check) and food (check) and supposedly good food.The only problem that our party of 6 had was the way the place was set up they don't allow smoking inside but they should of. All of the smokers were standing outside in front of a giant sliding garage style door and all of the smoke was sucked back into the bar. All of us agreed this is the worst place we have been in for smoke and some of our group were smokers they didn't even like it. So if your idea is to sit inside a smokey hazy bar you will love it but to sit in that atmosphere and dine was impossible. We left for cleaner air.
