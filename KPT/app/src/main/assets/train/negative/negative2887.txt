Girls looking for a sugar daddy guys looking for a cougar or if you're just a pretentious douche: Bossa Nova is the place for you.The atmosphere is downright tragic for how hard it tries.  The bar prices scream to the proletariat: Let them drink beer down the street! We only want the bourgeois in here.  Even the DJ they had during the Gallery Crawl a few weeks back was tragic.  I mean I know that the DJ has to appease the sugar daddies and cougars but is every place in Pittsburgh required to have 80s music?  I'm sure it is in the liquor license application.That said the barstaff is generally friendly and very quick - most likely so you don't realize you just paid eight dollars for a beer.
