French crepes are not the easiest food item to prepare and I certainly wasn't expecting Cordon Bleu quality. That said I found the crepes to be overly thick and the filling while tasty too skimpy and thus overpowered by the crepes wrap. But it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment. I was in Pittsburgh visiting a relative with terminal cancer at the nearby hospital ; she had requested a breakfast crepes so I found Cafe Parisiennes through Yelp. We were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours. The sign said the Cafe opened at 10:00AM which was when we arrived. We could see staff inside and asked if we could come in. The owner very curtly informed us they were still closed and might be ready in ten minutes or so. After another ten minutes we asked if we could wait inside because of the cold. Again the owner was brusque and not at all apologetic for being 20 minutes late opening - on a busy Saturday morning!! When I tried to engage him while giving my order I found him to be taciturn and argumentative; it was clear his young staff were feeling very uncomfortable watching the exchange. This is not the kind of attitude for anyone in a service business and I would definitely not recommend this establishment to anyone.
