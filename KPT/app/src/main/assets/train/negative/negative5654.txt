I agree 100% on Maggie G's review. Over priced bad food and Pittsburgh DOESN'T know GOOD Thai food.. Plus $40 bucks on Take out...seriously? Ill pass I've had better Thai for less. Yellow Curry (Ive added a picture of exactly how watery the curry truly is ) (x2) Spring Rolls (2 per order)Dumplings (5 per order) Wontons (4/5 per order)_____________40 BUCKSIll stick to Bangkok Balcony. No more trying out different Thai places in the city. I rather not waste my money on watered down curries and bland dishes which seems to be the norm for the Pittsburgh Thai scene.
