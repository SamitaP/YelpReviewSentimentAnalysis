Average food slightly above average prices for the quality/taste average price for the location lack-luster service.This place (the location the actual building itself etc.) could be so much more.  I wish they would either step it up or sell the business to someone that would let it achieve its true potential.Until then there are other dining options in Regent Square and they should be explored.
