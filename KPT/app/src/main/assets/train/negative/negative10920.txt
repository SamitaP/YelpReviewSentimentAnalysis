After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a sub and was completely unimpressed. Even though the shop was nearly empty the staff was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple times.The chicken parm sub I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of crispy breaded chicken inside it had plain unseasoned chicken slices which was covered in cheese and a sauce one step away from ketchup. To top it all off the sub was microwaved which made the inside insanely hot and turned to bread to rubber.Maybe their regulars subs are better but the next time I spend $10 on a sub and soda it definitely won't be here.
