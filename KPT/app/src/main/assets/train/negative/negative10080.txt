I have been to Cosmos' twice in my 18 years in North Carolina.  I must say the first time was a better experience.  I went during the CIAA the gratuity was 20%.  A grilled chicken sandwich cost me $11.00 (overpriced) the taste was substandard and no seasoning.  I guess you can say we recieved third quality food at high end prices. It was terrible.  The the service was okay and I was atmosphere was not that great.  I do not see myself returning.
