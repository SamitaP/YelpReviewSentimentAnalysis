I went to Lot 17 Bar and Grill after working late one evening to meet up with some friends. The look of the place is pretty decent with your standard bar seating but with the nice addition of an outdoor seating area which is great to people watch on the bussling streets of Bloomefield.I arrived last of my party and was starving thankfully the group had ordered sweet potato fries that came with an amazing cinamon butter for dipping!! And here's where things went south- like I mentioned before I arrived starving and we did not see our waitress for a good 10-15 minutes. When the waitress finally arrived I ordered a diet coke which came out 5-10 minutes later and tasted flat (come on people! Change the machine!) The next time the waitress appeared I quickly ordered the tuna steak salad with cilantro lime dressing which was actually pretty good- it contained won ton strips a pretty well done piece of tuna which I asked for medium and an assortment of what tasted to be pretty fresh vegatables. As we wrapped up the evening and received our checks we realized that the waitress didn't give me a bill but instead took it upon herself to add my salad to someone else's tab at my table without their heads up. Sadly to say even though my salad was pretty decent I'm going to have to give them just an ok review due to the terrible service..Here's to Lot 17..I hope you redeem yourself.
