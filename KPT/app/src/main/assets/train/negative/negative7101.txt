Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap and definitely very poor quality. Grease is the common theme in food and though it might taste OK a first your digestive tract may say otherwise later. The space was cramped we sat almost elbow to elbow with other guests with my back a foot from a brick wall. The waitresses were extremely fast except for coffee refills. Almost felt rushed because the bill came so quick; probably had something to do with the busy line in the waiting room. And why in this day and age are you cash-only Pamela?
