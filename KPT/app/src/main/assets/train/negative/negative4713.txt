I would write a 0 review if I could. I cannot review the food. I did not get a chance to eat there. Me and my Hawaiian friend went there to grab what I heard was some great Indian food during one of the Unblurred Friday evenings. The concierge looked at us disdainfully and was talking about how the 3-4 empty tables we saw was reserved. No reserved signs were in sight on these tables and dude did not mention when any seating would be freed up. Whether or not he was prick or or a racist prick I have no idea. He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in trying to serve us. It is Garfield so may be he has had issues with the local denizens causing trouble who happen to look like me. Dunno. All the white people get to eat we do not? With the exception of the Awesome Spak Brothers I would not bother eating anything on Penn Avenue. Ever. I spend more time focusing on the surrounding crap than I do with actually eating.
