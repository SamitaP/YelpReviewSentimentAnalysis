Okay it's a 2 star trending 3 stars in my mind. I went there before a Bobcats game with some friends. We were the only people in the entire place. It was kind of nice but a little bizarre as we'd expect atleast somebody else there but to no avail we were alone.They have some good stuff going for them: Practically TV's for wallpaper half price apps (yeah and it's better than that Applebee's garbage) a solid location and a pretty large bar.Just wish they had more people going in and out but hey faster service for me.
