Man I really want this place to be good... but it's not.  A shame - it's so convenient to get delivery (especially when it snowed hah).  Quintessential Chinese take-out isn't all that great in the first place but Cherry House's dishes don't even measure up to that standard.Probably the most annoying thing about the beef chicken or shrimp entrees is the abundance of vegetables.  Don't get me wrong - I love my greens but there just isn't much in the way of protein.  Having ordered a variety of entrees each of them just go overkill with the veggies.  You feel cheated - the dishes should be along the lines of snow peas carrots and a sampling of shrimp.  And to make matters worse despite the diversity of dishes available there's about three flavor profiles available:  (1) salty; (2) sweet; and (3) sweet and salty. Hot and Sour Soup - They're doing it wrong.  The viscosity is off and it's neither hot nor sour really.  When my sister visited and tried this place she said everything from there tastes like broom handle.  I've never had the pleasure of trying broom handle (and I don't know how she would know...) but I take it that it's no filet.For me the coup de grace was hair in my food the last two times I ordered!  Supremely unpleasant and tossed it out immediately.  You want to believe it was an accident the first time but when it happens twice in a row... it's no accident.  Something's busted with the people product or process.dmo out.
