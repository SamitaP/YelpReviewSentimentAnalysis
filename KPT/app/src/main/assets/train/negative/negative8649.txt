This place has a fantastic outdoor patio and makes for a great place to sip back and enjoy a few beers. We split the brewer's feast and particularly enjoyed the southwest egg rolls with a roasted jalapeno ranch dressing. I enjoyed their winter seasonal and their Sweet Magnolia brown ale. However they didn't make my top favorite beer selection and other than that I really didn't find any of their brews to be that great. Overall I'd recommend going elsewhere with a better beer selection from multiple breweries. Of course much of this review reflects my distaste for chain restaurants and breweries.
