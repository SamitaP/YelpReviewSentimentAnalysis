Well I went here with my friends and my 3 year old daughter for a dinner. I ordered the chicken tender platter with a side of fries and we had some calamari. With regards to foodit's so soI've been with few different places in Pittsburgh that really serves good enough calamari. I've from the Philippines so i know what is good and what's great in terms of calamari. Our server was okshe checked on us maybe twicethe only thing I can say is that she didn't tell us they only take cash and they don't take cards. I've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash. I'm a card person. I probably have a buck or two in my wallet coz I use my cards for everything. I have ten credit cards and 2 debit cards in my walletgood thing I remember my debit card pinmade a withdrawalpaid the atm fee and gave them cash. Imagine a place that's been around since forever and they don't take cards. Are u kidding me? Even mom and pop store accept cards.goodness. I am disappointed. We own a business so I can understand the merchant fees for card transactions but heyit's part of operating a business. The food was ok but it's not memorable.
