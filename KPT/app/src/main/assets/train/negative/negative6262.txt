So the majority of my food was good here appetizer (King Edward Mussels) dessert (sorbet) but the main course I ordered: soba noodle was horrible. It was way to salty which overwhelmed all other flavours.  Normally I would give a place a second chance but this is soba we are talking about the namesake of the restaurant.  For this price I would expect excellent food and great atmosphere which this place has failed to deliver.
