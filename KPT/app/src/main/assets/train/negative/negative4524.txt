Unfortunately this dump is right down the street from my hotel and not really having eaten much all day I was hungry.The service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.My husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.
