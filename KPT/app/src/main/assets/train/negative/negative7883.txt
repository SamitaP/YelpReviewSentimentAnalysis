Let me start off by premising the fact that I was at the mall I knew I could sit quickly at the bar and I had a gift card since christmas or I would not be eating at a chain restaurant. It was what you expect at all of the chains. I got chicken and shrimp carbonarra (spell check). It was fair. What does one expect for something quick and convenient to what I was doing at the time.  I do wish however that I spent the gift card next door just shoveling cheddar bays down my throat. Good talk.
