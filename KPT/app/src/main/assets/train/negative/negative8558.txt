We had lunch here during a rather unbusy Saturday.  Most places in this area seem to only serve dinner on Saturday so this was one the few seemingly vegan-friendly Saturday lunch spots.Sad to say my entree was a little bland. It was a tofu vegetables and wide rice noodles entree.  It surely looked spectacular with the varied vibrant colors and large portion size but it failed to delivery on tastiness!  No bother I drowned the sucker in chile sauce and soy sauce until it was more edible. The tofu spring rolls appetizer suffered from a similar tastelessness.  At least service was prompt and everything was salvageable with a little doctoring up.  I suspect that the omnivore dishes may be more palatable as my companion didn't seem bothered but she is polite gal so who knows!  The large portion size did permit me to chow down again later which is always appreciated when I am about to possibly spend all night throwing back drinks with little or no vegan options immediately available.  I don't know I'm willing to gander Soho Bistro is probably not too bad for most diners but it just didn't do it for me!
