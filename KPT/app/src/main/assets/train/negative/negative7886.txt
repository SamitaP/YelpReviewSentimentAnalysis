This is probably one of the worst Olive Garden I have been to. I am a frequent diner at Olive Garden but had my first experience with this particular one last week. My server was horrific. Being a previous server myself I can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night. However this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and I the entire time. Our salads came not even five minutes before our food was sent out. I am completely disappointed. I don't recommend this location to anyone.
