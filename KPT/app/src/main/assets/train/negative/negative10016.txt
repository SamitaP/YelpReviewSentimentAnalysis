Not a bad place but there are many others in Charlotte that are better. We where seated at a table so close to another couple that we might as well have eaten dinner with them. So if you are looking for atmosphere not your place.  Don't get me wrong Lavecchia's isn't bad it just isn't up to par with some of the other nice spots in CLT.
