Primanti's sandwiches pretty much sum up Pittsburgh in many ways:  big over-the-top tasteless and unhealthy.  What more could you ask for? Unfortunately this place is pretty dirty.  Make sure no flies land on your food.It seems like Pittsburgh natives love this place which is fine.  Its food certainly is unique.  However if you're not from Pittsburgh there's a good chance you'll walk away with a rather bland taste in your mouth.By the way do not pronounce the t in Primanti.  It really irks native Pittsburghers.  It's pronounced Primanny.  Unfortunately I learned this the hard way.
