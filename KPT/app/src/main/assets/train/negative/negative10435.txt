We tried Fujo for the last time. We never know if they are delivering. It changes by the day. When they do deliver it always takes longer than the estimated time. We have had to cancel our order before because drivers were extremely late. Today we were disappointed with the food we relieved. It was BLAND! There was no flavor at all. I can't say enough how upset I am with the lack of consistency this restaurant has. We'll take our business somewhere else.
