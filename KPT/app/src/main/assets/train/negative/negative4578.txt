I used to really like this place but the service can't be overlooked anymore.  I ate here recently on a monday afternoon (granted it's not the A team on Monday's) but  it was so obvious the staff just wanted to get us out of there so they could go back to reading star magazine.  The food was good not great but good enough.  The service as mentioned was poor.  The server was apathetic at best.  He didn't give us time to finish our soup before he had our entree's in front of us and a check on the table.  I think this was my last visit.
