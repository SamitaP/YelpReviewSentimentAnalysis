I walked in expecting a great experience. It has a great atmosphere. There was nothing wrong with our service but the food was overpriced and pretty meh. I had the tiramisu which is one of my favorites to get and it was horrible. It tasted like it came out of a Walmart freezer on clearance. Won't be coming back anytime soon.
