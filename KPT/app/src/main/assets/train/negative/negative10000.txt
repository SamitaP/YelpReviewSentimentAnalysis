There's a reason I avoid bagel sandwiches but I thought I'd give it another try. I ordered the Thai Chicken Sandwich which consists of a plain bagel smeared with cream cheese lettuce cucumber and a  chicken breast and it comes with a cup of Thai peanut sauce. Tasty indeed however what a large mess this made! As we all know bagels aren't the easiest breads to bite. Smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal. The cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a Bush Hog - everything wants to squirt out. No showers are in bathroom which is too bad as I needed one after eating my sandwich.With this said the staff was very nice. I just need to avoid bagel sandwiches....
