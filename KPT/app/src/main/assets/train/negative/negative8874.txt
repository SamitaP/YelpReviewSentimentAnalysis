It's OK.  It's soul food.  The fried chicken was straight forward.  Not likely to go back for just that as Price's is much better in my opinion.  I was also able to sample the BBQ pork... It was a tad weird.  My girlfriend accurately pointed out it tasted like curry.   I would steer clear of that. The mac and cheese was good because let's be honest it's cheese and cheese is good.  The collards were authentic and would get them again.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  Overall rating - Just an OK.
