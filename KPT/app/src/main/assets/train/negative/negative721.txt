This place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance offers quick take-out and the service is rude. I decided to give Tasty a try because it's conveniently located on Highland Avenue and has easy parking.I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon. Sadly they prepared Kung Pao Beef instead. It's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. It's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. While it wasn't what I ordered the food was good...but there is better Chinese food out there.
