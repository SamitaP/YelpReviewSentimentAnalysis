It's about 2.5. We live in Squirrel Hill with a lot of good restaurants and I thought this place is better than where we usually go. The pho is the cheapest in Pittsburgh but the portion is very small. The spring roll is the most expensive vietnamese spring roll. I ordered the Saigon soup for myself and #17 for my husband. My husband likes it because he is an america and like sweet stuff. Everything with coconut is good for him. These dishes we got doesn't look like what they showed on the photo. The Vietnamese place in Squirrel hill or the stripe is a lot better.
