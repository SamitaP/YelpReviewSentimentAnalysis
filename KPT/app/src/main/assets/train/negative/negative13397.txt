This is the ONLY chinese restaurant I like in Charlotte.The food is fresh and good.The price is very reasonable too.They have two kinds of menus.One for more americalized chinese food and one is the authentic one.U can find all the yummy food on the authentic menu.Beef noodle chicken feet pig hog...My favorite is the beef noodle and the pig feet.Recommand to call in to order before go because the owner is by herself most of the time and they're pretty busy at lunch and dinner hours------Update 02/26/2011The owner is different now and the new menu sucks! Just like other yucky American Chinese restaurant now! Will not come back again
