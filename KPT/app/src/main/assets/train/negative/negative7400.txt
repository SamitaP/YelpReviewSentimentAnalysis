First and far most people  I never write a bad review.  So imagine what an average experience I had. Actually this isn't even a bad review. OMG but the food was just so average.I've been to better Thai restaurants in the past. The pad thai was not good and that's what it should be!! The curries were very rich with vegetables but again weren't delicious. I have nothing against this place but if you have had really good thai food in other places then you have raised the bar and won't like this place. So if you're trying Thai food for the first time...don't hit this place. Sorry for being honest but look I'm really obsessed with Thai food and have tried most of the thai restaurants in Pittsburgh and this restaurant is not going on my favorite list. I don't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall. Just not going back there. Who cares what I think though everyone has a different taste. So you might like it just not me:-/
