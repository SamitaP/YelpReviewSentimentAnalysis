I've actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad. I tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy. For reasons I truly can't explain we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination. We both threw down a brew nasty paid and left. Unfortunately for Olive or Twist the visit would probably be our last.On a positive note there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set. His warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started. When it's all said and done we should have just went to the Sharp Edge down the street. Probably a much safer bet for future endeavors.
