NOT repeat Not for celiacs! The kitchen ignores whatever the server tells them. When the meal comes out wrong everyone else is done before the plate comes back out. The manager apologizes but it they don't take it seriously this happened both times we've been here but we won't be back. I like the food but I don't like dining alone.
