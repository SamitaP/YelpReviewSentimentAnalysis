I had two dogs fries and a coke for lunch.  The cheese was the individually wrapped American slices torn in 1/2 the bun was your plain white basic variety the chili right out of a can and the meat typical. Frankly (haha) it didn't do anything for me.  Because of some of the other stellar reviews I'll have to give it another try maybe the green dogs?  Friendly enough with a small town diner ambiance.
