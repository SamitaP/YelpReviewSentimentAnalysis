We've been to the Pineville location before and I have to say that the experience there is many times better than this one (at least on this night).  While everything was decent nothing really came together.  The jazz band was decent just don't make the mistake of sitting in the same room if you actually want to enjoy your meal talk with your companions that sort of thing.  If you're going for the music that's fine but for a quiet evening it is not the room to sit in!
