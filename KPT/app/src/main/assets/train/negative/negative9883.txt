Thinking about Matthew Broderick perhaps?  Erase that thought; this bar didn't really remind me of my college experience at all either.  There were too many meatheads pompous jocks that I don't miss leaving behind in my old high school days.  Don't get your undies in a wad I have plenty of friends that play sports and I like competitive sports as much as the next guy but a lot of these regulars are stereotypical steroid freaks.  I am getting myself in trouble here it very well could have been some kind of football after game outing.  I managed to meet an older brother that was into the Pistons this was the highlight of the evening.  Either way I am not taking the chance again with this place.
