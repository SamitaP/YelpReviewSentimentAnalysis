I'm not one to complain and I am not a picky eater but that was undoubtedly the worst meal I have ever had. For eggs Benedict that came out over 30 minutes after ordering it I would've expected it to at least be edible. The hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it. The only decent part of the meal was the potatoes which were just roasted with salt and pepper. Definitely will not be returning for food.
