I visited Lot 17 on an uncommonly warm late Friday in October for lunch with a buddy from work. We were walking down Liberty and went into Lot 17 on a lark. I wish that lark would have kept me going down Liberty Ave. to find somewhere else with tastier grub.When we walked into the restaurant it was totally dead aside from one other table of diners. I figured the place should be bustling since it was such a delightful day outside but I soon came to realize why the place was a ghost town.The simple lunch menu of burgers sandwiches salads and wraps is nice and compact. I chose a turkey burger and regular fries which arrived in a timely fashion. The fries were tasty... after I salted them. There was absolutely no salt of them when they came out. The turkey burger was seasoned well but it was dry as a bone. I suspect the turkey patty was frozen but the burger was so overcooked I cannot say for sure.Our server was attentive and friendly. The building is clean polished and has some nice HDTVs. When I chose  to go to Lot 17 I figured I was trying it out for the first time. After we ate lunch I realized I had gone there once in the past for lunch with other co-workers. What does this mean? Lot 17 is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination. Even with my below-average experience I think the place has potential but the execution was just not there on my visit. I hope they can step it up at lunch in the future.
