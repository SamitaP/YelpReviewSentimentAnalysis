I don't know why but this McDonalds always managed to get my order wrong.  This is almost constant.   However there is a young assistant management who is extremely professional and friendly.  He make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly. I believe his name is Matt or something that begins with a M.  (Young guy brown hair and awesome tattoos).    The major complaint that I have with this location is when the high schools let out.  The tons of students just hang out cussing or making a lot of noise.  They sit on tables and often just sit at your table.  When Arby's and Wendy's use to be open next door the management did not put up with this loitering.
