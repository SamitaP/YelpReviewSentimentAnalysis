I think one star is being HIGHLY generous for this restaurant. My family and I visited Roland's on a Sunday afternoon for some lunch. It was by far the worst experience at a restaurant I have had. My husband and I both ordered the Lobster Rolls and I order my daughter pasta from the kids menu. It took the staff SO LONG to bring our lunch and when it finally came my husband and I both got our sandwiches but my daughter got nothing. Of course she was not happy about that at all and trying to calm her down we were giving her our food so that she had something but she really wanted her pasta. My husband went to talk to the manager and our server came over but STILL NO PASTA. 15-20 minutes later the pasta finally came out. And of course it was scalding hot. Not only was the pasta so hot that it was inedible (especially for a kid) there was a POOL of greasy butter and oil in the bottom of the bowl. I think my kid ate more of the grease than the actual pasta. It was DISGUSTING. This was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant. Not to mention that the lobster roll was not even that great and definitely not worth $16. (Maybe it would have been better if it didn't sit on my plate for twenty minutes while I waited for my daughter's food). Don't waste your time here especially if you have kids. The staff (minus our waitress who was really nice and it wasn't her fault) are a bunch of bozos.
