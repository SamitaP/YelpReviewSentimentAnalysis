I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant especially since burgatory just opened across the street.
