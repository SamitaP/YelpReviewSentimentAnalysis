This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture? she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers.
