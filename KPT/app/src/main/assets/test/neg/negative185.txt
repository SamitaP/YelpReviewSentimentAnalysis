In my opinion Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink maybe start to sing a few lyrics drink some more think of a song you wanna hear put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper you drink they play it everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time it's not worth it. But again that's just me.The 2 stars are for the piano players who are entertaining and very talented and the Rock Bottom brews they serve.
