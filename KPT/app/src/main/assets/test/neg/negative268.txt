SUMMARY:If I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go I might come back for beer and appetizers.GOOD:- Decent beer...- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.- Amusing name.BAD:- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer appetizers and a better main course at plenty of breweries.- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.Come if you want bar food but keep your expectations low.
