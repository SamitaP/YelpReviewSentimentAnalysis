Eat n Park is usually decent.  This location though has HORRIBLY SLOW service.  Seriously we never wait less than 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us and we live near the Waterfront so we've given this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times.  Each time hoping that the last was just a fluke new staff or something.  It's not.  Doesn't matter what time we go.  It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally we've had a stellar service but it's few and far between.  Today after waiting 15 minutes then getting up to find a server in another section we were informed that we were sitting in a closed section.  That server offered to serve us but honestly we left.  I told the hostess who seated us about the mixup and got a blank stare.  I've never had this issue at any other EnP.  We left drove to the Squirrel Hill location and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the Waterfront.  Mgmt- you have a beautiful prime location.  Get your hosts and servers on the same page!
