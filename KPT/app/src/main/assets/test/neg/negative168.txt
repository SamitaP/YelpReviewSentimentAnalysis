I love Steak N Shake. This one however leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there.
