All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles a scooter and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.Our food came... no water to drink no tea medium temperature food. Of course its cold just like the room I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty the shrimp was mushy the fried rice was bright yellow.We asked for water they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?Over all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap and deservingly so.
