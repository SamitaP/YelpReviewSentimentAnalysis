Not much of a review for this one but just a few tidbits of info...Pool (on Friday/Saturday) is $14 per hour(I'm pretty sure its $10 through the week)Mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location.The food is crap.The games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they're the big tournament style/size not the shitty bar-room tiny pool tables).That is all.  :)(the pricing is based on my recent trip.We shot pool for a few hours I had a bar tab (that wasn't out of control) and my night ended up costing me $60
