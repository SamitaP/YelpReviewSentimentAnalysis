Meh I've experienced better is an understatement.Friday's is like the fine dining chain for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...1.  When we were seated it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that.2.  I ordered one of their skinny margaritas blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size however at $6.00/pop that was half of my food bill.3.  The waitress started off attentive but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha!4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle.5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.  Disappointment.6.  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  Never again will I eat at Friday's.  I will however go should a happy hour arise...
