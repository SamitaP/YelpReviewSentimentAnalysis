This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  I've had pretty good experiences inside it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.  It's the rare place I can get a Frisco Melt well the ONLY place I can get a Frisco Melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk Walk In OR Drive Thru.Just take a gun on Weekends you'll be fine.
