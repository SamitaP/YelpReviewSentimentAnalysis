Nice staff but apparently there is little manager oversight around 3:28am.I do like this place.  It must be nice to work somewhere that allows you to choose your own tasks.  Like smoking sitting and texting.  I'm fine with cooking my food being fourth on the to do list because there is no where else togo really....Why didn't they answer me at the drive through? I think they wanted me to come inside because my girlfriend and I are really really really good looking.This was annoying but understandable.
