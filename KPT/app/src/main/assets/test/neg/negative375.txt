This is one of those places where the presentation is nice but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft $5 mixed drinks and half off appetizers. When we got there we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. I only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr√©es but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. Overall I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.
