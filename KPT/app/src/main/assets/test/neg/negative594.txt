Okay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne PA which is outside of Pittsburgh from Harrisburg PA of all places. Where I am at really there is no delivery but these guys did. They were nice and cordial and cheap but I have been spoiled by the pizza shop in Harrisburg Downtown run my an old world Italian guy named Luigi. That pizza is/was MILES better than this. This crust while thin did not have flavor and was hard. The slices were small for their 8 slice which I did like. The cheese was good. The sauce was meh. I've definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering.
