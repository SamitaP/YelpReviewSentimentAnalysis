We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said yep and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred the manager said What do you want me to do?My friend said An apology would be a good start whereupon the manager looked back at him and said Get out and don't come back ???????? Are you kidding????My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way shape or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. That being said we left and went back to 131 East where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.There are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service.
