My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. When our food came though everything was below average. They have a huge selection of games for the kids to play but you pay dearly to play games here. The food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced.
