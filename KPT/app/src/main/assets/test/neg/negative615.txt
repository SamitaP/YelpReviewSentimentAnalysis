Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!Their steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.The seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either suffering as they did from that certain I taste like iodine flavor.The advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late given the location but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up but just for you Yelpers I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).
