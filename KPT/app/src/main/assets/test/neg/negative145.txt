Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable the smiles and laughter is always there.  How can I stay mad when the prices or so cheep? Myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was $31.00On this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department got there realized they didn't have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it off...only at Eatn' Park.My baked potato was hard as a rock I had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one. The waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which I thought was sweet.
