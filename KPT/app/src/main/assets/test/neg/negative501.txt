I've had bad experiences here a few times now.  I wrote panera bread and haven't heard back.  Bad service all around!!!  Basically we ordered our food they ran out of what we wanted so just decided to make us something else with out telling us.  When we got our food we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay and how about you give us our money back.  Really you don't get much for what you pay for at panera.  Its not very good at all.
