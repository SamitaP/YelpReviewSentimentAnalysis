I am bummed about this- I had high hopes. Here's a rundown of the evening:Pros:- super friendly waitress Stephanie who maintained her professionalism and friendliness throughout - yummy elderflower and pear beverage- lobster bisque was nice and lobster-y- hot delicious breadCons:- oysters were sketch. And I don't feel good about that. Stephanie brought us an order of East Coast oysters to replace the West Coast ones that we sent back.- fresh grated horseradish had NO flavor or heat- what's up with that?- scallops were meh- came with weird veggies unevenly seared and no real flavor. And at a whopping $25 a plate I expect some nummers!I doubt we'll go back- for those prices I would prefer McCormick's or Ruth's Chris.
