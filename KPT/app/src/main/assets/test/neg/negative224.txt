Dave and Buster's is an enigma is it dining a bar or  playground for video game lovers? Let me get the bar part out of the way first it's overpriced and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. Next the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront there are sandwiches burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger who doesn't?) pasta salads chicken fingers yadda yadda. The games I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.Overall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront but it's time to update the menu update the games and get into the second decade of the 21st century.
