I made it back here about two weeks ago.  I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July.  Whether or not it was an off night I do not know but the place was loud and crowded the service was bad and the food was mediocre at best.  I should have just waited it out at Point Brugge.  I won't becoming back anytime soon.
