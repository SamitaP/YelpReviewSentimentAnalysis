Eat at your own risk. The service is terrible the staff seem to be generally clueless the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes and there's no sense of FAST in their fast food. When we came half of the menu board was still on breakfast and it was 4:30p. The only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like McDonald's should. Then again the franchise is owned by Rice and I've come to take terrible service is their MO.
