Eh this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.Bobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait.
