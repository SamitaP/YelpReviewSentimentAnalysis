I don't care what Cub and Bulls fans think this Steeler and Penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. First the crust tastes like a biscuit and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. I will give UNOs a thumbs up on it's flatbread it's better pizza than some pizzerias In the area. When I look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me this place is a dud. Guess what? Chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either!
