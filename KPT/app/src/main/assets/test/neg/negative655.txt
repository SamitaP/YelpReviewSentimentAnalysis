I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze to begin with.  They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking but it just had no flavor.  To be fair we did go for dinner and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  For dinner though unless you like super-bland food I probably wouldn't return for seconds.
