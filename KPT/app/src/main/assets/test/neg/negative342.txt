The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu and if you have developed a foodie palate don't even bother because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise you are better off skipping it.
