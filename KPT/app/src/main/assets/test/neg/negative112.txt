Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables the decorations the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.I ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?  Ambiance like I said left much to be desired.  I don't think I'd have this place on my list of musts for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit!
