I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was to quote some phrases they kept repeating you bitch you slut you whore and  twinkle twinkle little slut why don't you take it up the butt which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth sixth seventh time. Or maybe not.
