I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.They have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus the selection is awesome. It is a sports-themed bar so you can expect drunk locals loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that so it doesn't bother me although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new as they can't tell you a thing about it. The biggest downfall of Duke's though is the food. I've had three different but equally simple dishes there; A Burger a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. Their fries are very good. And so are the wings.I'd say Duke's is a good place to drink but that's about it.
