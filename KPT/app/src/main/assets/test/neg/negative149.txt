This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. The bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's) our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.If not for the compensation I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf on the other hand was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.I think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...PS. The whole joint smells like major B.O.
