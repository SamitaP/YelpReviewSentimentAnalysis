This McDonald's is so bad it's amazing.  Order:  Big mac large fries diet coke.The soda machine was broken.   No sodas.Then I got to the window.  We rang you up for medium fries.   (Not what I asked for)  Well if you want a large you're gonna have to wait 4 minutes.  We just started a new batch.Left with:  Big mac medium fries no coke.Actually now that I think about it this was one of my better experiences there...
