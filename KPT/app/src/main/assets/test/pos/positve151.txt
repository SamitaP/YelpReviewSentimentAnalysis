I heart Steak N Shake. I love the fact that the fries are shoestring the burgers get to you pretty fast they're a little greasy and the food is super cheap.I visited Steak and Shake on New Year's Eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying. I was unnaturally attracted to their Wisconsin Buttery Burger which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. Sounds good right?Well I get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. The pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  I took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and I literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things I had eaten in a long time.This is not meant to be a fine dining experience. Service wasn't fast but it wasn't slow. It just kind of was. However the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take X amount of time to all patrons. So I give them a pass for being upfront about it.Next trip to Pgh is going to feature Steak and Shake - I guarantee it.
