We're always looking for non-chain restaurants by the Waterfront (they do exist...) and this has become a favorite. I've had the Hot Roast Beef & Fries and the Corned Beef on Rye and both were delicious. Every beer I've had here has been ice cold and the service has been strong too. It's a great place to watch a Pirates game too.
