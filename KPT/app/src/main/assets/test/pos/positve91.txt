Perfect time with hubby after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal waitress was such an adorable girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job!Strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) Strawberry milkshake nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!Its always nice when u go late at night like us it is not crowded not noisy nice music playing and always nice people around. If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!
