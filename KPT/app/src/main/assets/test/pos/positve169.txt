I never thought that I'd be giving Steak 'n Shake a 4 star review but I really enjoyed my dinner here tonight. It just hit the spot!I was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door. He apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time. However everything was delivered promptly and he made what would've been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience.I ordered a grilled cheese and fries. The grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty perfectly melty cheese. I love Steak 'n Shake's thin and crispy fries and these were as delicious as I had expected.For just $9 for me and my husband I have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive Steak 'n Shake was. Based on the cost the food and our fantastic waiter we'll be back soon.
