My wife and I went here around 10pm on a Saturday night. The food was not spectacular about the same quality that you'd get at an Applebee's or some place similar -- good but not great.  My steak was tough but my wife enjoyed hers. Staff was relatively unorganized (we ate at a table next to the bar) and had to wait awhile for a server. Food was prompt.
