We met our good friends from Morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu. I had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there I was jonesing for it. It certainly delivered. The crust was great the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient. Our friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - as good as the pizza was this was _much_ better. We'll return again to this beautifully lit gem in Carnegie PA soon!
