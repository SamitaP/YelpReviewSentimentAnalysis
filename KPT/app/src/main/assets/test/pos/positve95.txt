This is one of my husband's fave restaurants in town. My husband generally orders Chicken Parm which is very good. Their sauce is quite good. They serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum. I generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name but can't recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and I get it with blue cheese pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. A tad pricey for a salad that's just lettuce and cheese (I want to say about $8 with the extras) but really good. (Especially with some cracked black peeper.) I tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans. The place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. It has a comfortable feeling. It also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the 'burgh. Unfortunately we've never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner!
