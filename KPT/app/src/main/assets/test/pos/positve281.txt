Even since Rock Bottom opened (7 years ago???) I have always thought it was a dance club.  I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. Well I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close. Part of this is my fault...I always order healthy items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.  I started off with one of their wheat beers it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day Off the Hook Fish Dish Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. My friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.Pros: A lot of tables (no wait) brew special beers big menu could hear the dueling piano bar next doorCons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside most of the food was fried cheese filled cream based or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip burger and ice cream sundae.  (I would love to but its just not in my cards). I do like like when causal places offer some healthy options.
