Visiting from Toronto I was really impressed! The amount of tickets to be won was incredible. We usually got 200 tickets per play on average. Compared to Playdium here that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food.
