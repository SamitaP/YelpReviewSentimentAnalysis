This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty full-sized meals lots to choose from and not too crowded or noisy. Although for the sake of full disclosure I didn't sit at the bar and I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. Really I have no complaints about this place so I'm surprised by the few low ratings here.
