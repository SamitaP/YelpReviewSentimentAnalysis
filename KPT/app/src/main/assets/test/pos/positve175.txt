Steak 'n Shake's food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad for the quantity of food. I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing. The salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons tomatoes carrots cabbage lettuce and chicken breast. (They forgot the cheese!) The staff wasn't very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didn't want to be there. There usually is a long wait at Steak 'n Shake but if you catch them when they aren't busy you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. I do like their food and you can eat healthy options but the staff isn't helpful and the quality isn't always there.
