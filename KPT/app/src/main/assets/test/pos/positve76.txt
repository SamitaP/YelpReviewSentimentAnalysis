Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest nor the best decor.  But that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again.
