Ah Steak n Shake you hit the spot after a night of drinking. Open 24 hours drive thru or dine in with wonderful cheap greasy burgers chicken fingers breakfast sandwiches and shoestring fries. You're faster (and cheaper!) than Eat N Park. Plus your employees wear those adorable bow ties. Granted if we were at a fancy party I might act like I don't know you but deep down inside you know I heart you.
