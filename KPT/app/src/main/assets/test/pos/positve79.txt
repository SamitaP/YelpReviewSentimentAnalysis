I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. (I think I feel my heart yelling at me again)  The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet  I just might go back and ask her to marry me! But then again  she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online. Maybe she just wanted my positive response. Ok Sarah B. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?
