ehh 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that I've been here a few times but never wrote a review for D&B. I'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)The food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches salads appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)Drinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. The prizes- as others have noted the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they cost However it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1300?) a coffee mug a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.Overall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. I can't lie though I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.
