I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  I was greeted by a large open (garage style) window that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.Ordered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back.
