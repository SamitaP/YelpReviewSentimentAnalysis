I thought the interiors were very nice.  We stopped here on a Friday night & I was glad they weren't busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing.  My daughter & I split a chicken parm sandwich which was really good. Instead of it being served on a hoagie it was served on thin bread- like focaccia or something.  It was pretty good- little messy.The desserts looked amazing.  I thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside.  The kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windows.I would return.
