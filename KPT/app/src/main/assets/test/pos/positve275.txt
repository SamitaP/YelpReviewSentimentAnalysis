Nobody has reviewed this in a while but I am surprised at the lack of lovin'!  My husband and I ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot.We started with drinks--he got the house-brewed Portland Wheat and said it was quite a good beer and I got a mixed drink (Red Rock) that was also tasty.  He got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.We are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake come on!Our food and service was great.  They had the Penguins game on all the TVs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  Seriously what's not to like!?  I'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :)
