A table for 16 please...   That is what I had to ask for and knew that D&B could accomodate.I happen to be in the Homestead area for work.   I really wanted to dig into my Yelp bag of tricks provided by local Yelpers and introduce my team to the Shock and Awe they deserved but ... the shear numbers would made it hard.When I started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch - The only idea I could come up with was the Golden Corral - I knew that was not going to work for me.We decided to do something local and walking distance - D&B was it.It is what you expect - quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but I had to forgo any festivities - it was a work lunch.   I was pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu.   I am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of Family Guy.The waitress was very friendly and organized.    I ordered the Cabo style Chicken - Chicken Breast lightly seasoned and char-grilled topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables.It was eh...   The chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland.  The rice was bland.  The vegetables were cold.   I really blame it on the fact I was with 15 compatriots for lunch so I am giving it a fair rating.  Everything was edible.My team went with deep fried foods and burgers.   They seemed pleased.Service - very goodFood - okay not great.   My meal was $13Ambiance - well it was clean but there were not really any people in D&BThere are so many other choices for lunch that are local and close.  I would definitely recommend another in Squirrel Hill - I suggest you use Yelp to find you a better one (then come back and play! ;-) )
