First time at Dave & Buster's and although I didn't go for the games I was slightly disappointed. I went with a group of girls for dinner and drinks. The service was slow but the food was decent. The portions were huge but they are priced slightly higher than the average chain.       We went before 9 pm and there were a ton of kids there on a Friday night. I do suggest if you want to avoid the children to go after 9.
