I thought this place was pretty decent. My friend and I were both still reeling from thanksgiving dinner so we ordered salads... and they were HUGE. and tasty. I liked my salad though it was slathered in way too much dressing. My friend's was even more slathered so she didn't dig it too much. We'd also ordered chips with guacamole the guac was pretty good. my friend enjoyed her beer. I enjoyed my coke (I know I'm lame).so yeah... wasn't bad wasnt the best but it was okay.
