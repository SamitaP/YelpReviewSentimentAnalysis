Burgers are not the best quality. Better than McDonald's but not much better. The fries are fairly thin but crispy. They aren't bad. The prices are also quite decent. However their shakes are amazing. Thick and creamy. It's also great that they have half off shakes on weekdays in the early morning like 1-3am.
